# Primary manager state

Last reviewed: 2026-09-09

## Integration baseline

- Main baseline incorporated before KT-016 integration: `0bdbfc15`
- Manager branch: `codex/integration`
- Production access: disabled by standing decision.

## Active work

- `KT-009`: Gmail forwarding-verification delivery is on `origin/main`; waiting
  for final user validation before archival.
- `KT-012`: repository Markdown and development-instruction architecture cleanup
  is approved, verified, and delivered through integration commit `8a54f63c`.
- `KT-015`: reports endpoint authorization hardening is verified and delivered
  through integration commit `7b183989`.
- `KT-016`: unified admin catalog tabs and SYSTEM-card creation are integrated
  on `codex/integration`; focused backend tests and both production builds pass.

## Pending integration

- None from worker worktrees.

## Open decisions

- Add the second developer's shared profile after their name, role, and owned
  areas are supplied.
- None affecting the documentation architecture. The second developer's
  profile can be added later without changing the shared workflow.

## Next step

Fast-forward and push verified KT-016 to `main`.
