Last reviewed: 2026-09-10

## Integration baseline

- Main baseline incorporated before KT-016 integration: `0bdbfc15`
- Manager branch: `codex/integration`
- Production access: disabled by standing decision.

## Active work

- `KT-009`: Gmail forwarding-verification delivery is on `origin/main`; waiting
  for final user validation before archival.
- `KT-012`: repository Markdown and development-instruction architecture cleanup
  is approved, verified, and delivered through integration commit `8a54f63c`.
- `KT-015`: reports endpoint authorization hardening is verified and delivered
  through integration commit `7b183989`.
- `KT-016`: unified admin catalog tabs and SYSTEM-card creation are verified and
  delivered to `origin/main` through `bb784bae`.
- `KT-017`: admin educational-content pilot with the first three self-employed
  guide slides is verified and delivered to `origin/main` through `5cd8012b`.
- `KT-018`: refined self-employed guide opening sequence is verified and
  delivered to `origin/main` through `5a099fb2`.

## Pending integration

- `KT-019`: VAT report attachment parity is integrated and verified on
  `codex/integration`; normal push to `origin/main` is pending.

## Open decisions

- Add the second developer's shared profile after their name, role, and owned
  areas are supplied.
- None affecting the documentation architecture. The second developer's
  profile can be added later without changing the shared workflow.

## Next step

Push KT-019, then visually verify Drive and manual expense attachments in the
VAT report. No production deployment was performed.
