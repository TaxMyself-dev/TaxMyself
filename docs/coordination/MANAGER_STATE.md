  for final user validation before archival.

  is approved, verified, and delivered through integration commit `8a54f63c`.

  guide slides is verified and delivered to `origin/main` through `5cd8012b`.

## Pending integration

- None from worker worktrees.

## Open decisions

- Add the second developer's shared profile after their name, role, and owned
  areas are supplied.
- None affecting the documentation architecture. The second developer's
  profile can be added later without changing the shared workflow.

## Next step

Visually verify Drive and manual expense attachments in the VAT report after
deploying both backend and frontend. No production deployment was performed.
