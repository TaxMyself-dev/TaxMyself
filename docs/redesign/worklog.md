# Categories & accounting redesign — worklog

## 2026-07-10 — Session 1 (Phase 0, complete)

Ran Phase 0 in full against `keepintax_prodcopy`, a database restored from
`_prod_dump/keepintax-prod.sql` on the shared MySQL host (per Elazar's
explicit direction — no local MySQL client/server exists on this machine,
so "local copy" for this project means this dedicated database on the
existing shared host, not `keepintax-dev`).

- **0.1/backup**: verified the dump restores cleanly and repeatably (did
  so three times this session, see "issues" below).
- **0.2/0.4**: ran every query from `categories-audit.md §8`, wrote
  `production-baseline.md`. All D14 figures re-verified exactly except one
  correction (see below). Zero orphans, zero duplicate catalog rows.
  Applied both protective UNIQUE constraints from `cutover.sql` §1.
- **0.6**: full schema-drift audit, `schema-drift.md`. 9/14 tables clean.
  5 gaps found: 2 already anticipated by D2/D14 (`subAccountCode`,
  `subCounterAccountCode` — never migrated to prod), 3 new
  (`journal_entry.referenceId` type/nullability mismatch — open item;
  missing `@Index` on `expense.source_document_id`; two undeclared +
  unnamed indexes on `extracted_document`, likely the actual mechanism
  behind the known dev-DB synchronize thrash — both are cheap entity-only
  fixes, not yet applied since they weren't asked for this session).
- **0.5**: `backend/scripts/generate-baseline-reports.ts`, 9 businesses
  with journal data, per-period + aggregate VAT/P&L + full ledger, in
  `docs/redesign/baseline-reports/`.

**Corrections made to the plan this session** (both approved by Elazar):
- D15's Bituach Leumi delta was wrong ("~₪29,645" → actual ₪22,645 gross /
  ₪11,775.40 `amountForTax`, the latter being what P&L actually sums).
  Corrected in the master plan and in the new
  `docs/redesign/intentional-diffs.md` registry (correction #1).
- D12.4 (`UNIQUE(business.businessNumber)`) was blocked by a real
  duplicate (`businessNumber` 314719279 on two empty test rows, ids 5 and
  12). Investigated, zero dependents on either side, Elazar chose to keep
  id 5. Staged as `cutover.sql` §2 (delete id 12, then the constraint),
  rehearsed and verified against `keepintax_prodcopy`. Ships in Session 8
  with the rest of D12, not now.

**Tooling fix**: `AccountSeedService.onModuleInit` now honors
`SKIP_BOOT_SEED=true` (no-op) — booting the full Nest app against
`keepintax_prodcopy` was silently growing `default_category`/
`default_sub_category` via the boot-time seeder. Confirmed harmless to
report totals (the seeder never touches `journal_entry`/`journal_line`,
and left `default_booking_account` — what the P&L join reads — completely
unchanged), but it broke the "byte-for-byte mirror of prod" invariant the
redesign work depends on. Deleted along with the whole service in Phase
2.6; re-import-the-dump documented as the fallback if the flag ever stops
covering every write path.

**Issues hit and recovered from, for the record:**
1. First `generate-baseline-reports.ts` run didn't set `NODE_ENV`, so
   TypeORM's `synchronize` (on by default outside `NODE_ENV=production`)
   partially mutated `keepintax_prodcopy`'s schema before crashing on an
   unrelated `feezback_webhook_events` duplicate-key error. Recovered by
   `DROP DATABASE` + full re-import — the dump file itself was never at
   risk. **Lesson: always set `NODE_ENV=production` when booting the app
   against this DB**, now baked into the script's usage comment.
2. Even with `synchronize` off, `AccountSeedService` still mutated catalog
   tables on boot (see "Tooling fix" above) — required a second re-import
   and root-caused before the real baseline fixtures were generated.

**Phase 0 checklist status**: 0.1/0.2/0.4/0.5/0.6 done. 0.3 (D12 security
fixes) deferred to Session 8 per Elazar's standing decision — D12.4 is
investigated and staged, D12.1–D12.3 not yet started.

**Next**: Session 2 (Phase 1.1–1.3, the new chart of accounts) —
`Current phase: 1` set in `CLAUDE.md`.

## 2026-07-10 — Session 2 (Phase 1.1–1.3, complete)

Read the master plan + `schema-drift.md` first, per the runbook. Built the
full proposed chart as a review table
(`docs/redesign/phase1-chart-review.md`) and presented it BEFORE writing any
seed code, per the Session 2 prompt.

- **Discrepancy found and flagged, not silently resolved**: the plan's task
  1.3 text says sections come from "the current 18 P&L categories." A
  targeted search (reports.service.ts, expenses.service.ts, frontend,
  categories-audit.md) found exactly 16 distinct `pnlCategory` strings, not
  18. Proceeded with 16 (documented in the review doc and the plan's
  checkbox); Elazar did not have 2 specific additional sections in mind
  when asked.
- **Two review-gate questions resolved with Elazar** (AskUserQuestion):
  1. `code6111` — no verified source for the official Form 6111 code list
     exists in the repo. Rather than guess (explicitly forbidden by D2/1.3),
     left every account's `code6111` NULL. Elazar will provide the official
     list in a later session.
  2. Confirmed the new `90200 גביית מע"מ` technical account (D14 decision
     3) as the VAT-remittance clearing account, distinct from the existing
     transactional `2400`/`2410` accounts.
- **Numbering formula used** (documented in `chart.seed.ts` and the review
  doc): balance-sheet 1000–2999 unchanged; income `new = old × 10`; expense
  parents/sub-ledger `new = old + 55000`. Produces a 62-row chart (9
  balance-sheet + 2 income + 14 expense parents + 34 sub-ledger accounts +
  3 brand-new D14 technical accounts) and a 50-row `account_code_migration`
  map (62 minus the 9 unchanged minus the 3 brand-new).
- **Entities**: `AccountingSection` (new), `BookingAccount` (renamed from
  `DefaultBookingAccount`/`default_booking_account`, extended per D1.2),
  `AccountCodeMigration` (new, holds the migration map as real rows). All
  three registered in `bookkeeping.module.ts` and `app.module.ts`, but
  deliberately **not** wired into any boot-time seeder — `chart.seed.ts` is
  flat data only, consumed by Phase 1.4/2.6's future runner, not by the
  existing `AccountSeedService` (which keeps seeding the OLD `account.seed.ts`
  chart unchanged, so current runtime behavior is untouched this session).
- **Rename ripple**: `DefaultBookingAccount` → `BookingAccount` updated
  across every real caller (not just the entity file) —
  `account-seed.service.ts`, `account.seed.ts`, `bookkeeping.service.ts` +
  spec, `reports.service.ts`, `reports.module.ts`, `documents.service.ts`,
  `documents.module.ts`, `demo-data.service.ts`, `app.module.ts`,
  `ledger-report.dto.ts` (comment only). `tsc --noEmit` clean on every
  touched file; remaining pre-existing errors (users/auth specs,
  report-workflow spec) are untouched and unrelated.
- **New shared enums**: `OwnerType`, `VisibilityScope`,
  `SYSTEM_CHART_OWNER_KEY` added to `src/enum.ts` (D4) — will be reused by
  Phase 2's `Category`/`SubCategory` entities.

**Open item carried forward**: `docs/redesign/phase1-chart-review.md` §0
item 4 (six sub-ledger accounts whose name collides with their parent
account's name, e.g. `60103 הוצאות משרד` under parent `60100 הוצאות משרד`)
— left as-is pending Elazar's rename decision; harmless (only `code` is
unique) but worth a pass before Phase 2 exposes these as picker options.

**Next**: Session 3A (1.5, `getNextAccountCode`) may run in parallel with a
future Session 2-continuation; Session 4 (1.4, the actual renumbering
script) needs Plan Mode and Elazar's `code6111` list would help but isn't
blocking since 1.4 only touches account codes, not 6111.

## 2026-07-10 — Session 3A (Phase 1.5, complete)

New `AccountCodeAllocatorService`
(`backend/src/bookkeeping/account-code-allocator.service.ts`), registered
(and exported) in `bookkeeping.module.ts`. `getNextAccountCode({ ownerType,
type, chartOwnerKey }, manager?)` returns the next free `booking_account`
code as a string.

- **Ranges implemented exactly per D2**: SYSTEM income 40000–49999 /
  expense 60000–69999; ACCOUNTANT income 50000–59999 / expense
  70000–79999; CLIENT income 50000–59999 (shared numeric range with
  ACCOUNTANT — isolation is by `chartOwnerKey`, per D2's
  `UNIQUE(chartOwnerKey, code)`, not by code range) / expense 80000–89999.
- **Scope decision, not in the plan text, flagged here rather than
  guessed silently**: the function only auto-allocates `type: 'income' |
  'expense'`. The 90000–99999 "technical/adjustment" range and the
  1000–2999 balance-sheet range are hand-seeded (see `chart.seed.ts`'s
  90100/90200/90300 D14 rows) — nothing in the plan describes a runtime
  flow that allocates into either range, so the service throws a clear
  `BadRequestException` for any other `type` rather than inventing a
  range. Revisit if Phase 5's D11 "כרטיס טכני בלבד" flow turns out to need
  one.
- **Algorithm**: loads existing `code`s for the given `chartOwnerKey` only,
  filters to those numerically inside the target range (out-of-range
  manual codes are ignored, not treated as errors — "tolerated"), takes
  the max + 10, or the range floor if none exist. Throws if the range is
  exhausted. Takes an optional `EntityManager` so callers (Phase 2
  `CatalogService`, Phase 5 D11 add-account flow) can allocate inside
  their own transaction.
- **Tests**: `account-code-allocator.service.spec.ts`, 14 cases — floor
  per ownerType/type pair, jump-of-10 continuation, per-chartOwnerKey
  isolation, out-of-range manual codes ignored, in-range off-grid manual
  codes jumped from without collision, unknown type throws, exhausted
  range throws, EntityManager override bypasses the injected repo. All
  green. `tsc --noEmit` shows zero new errors (pre-existing failures in
  `users`/`report-workflow` specs are untouched).

**Next**: Session 2-continuation or Session 4 (1.4, the renumbering
script) per the runbook.

## 2026-07-10 — Chart-revision session (1.2/1.3 REVISED, APPROVED & COMMITTED)

Triggered by same-day revisions to D1/D3/D5/D9/D11 (accounting law — vat%,
tax%, isEquipment, reductionPercent, recognition — moved from `sub_category`
onto the `booking_account` card). Rebuilt `chart.seed.ts` and extended
`BookingAccount` before task 1.4; **stopped short of committing**, per this
session's explicit instruction — awaiting Elazar's review of
`docs/redesign/phase1-chart-review.md` (full rewrite) and
`docs/redesign/chart-review.xlsx` (regenerated, now includes the five new
law columns).

- **Entity**: added `vatPercent`/`taxPercent`/`reductionPercent` (decimal,
  nullable), `isEquipment` (boolean, nullable), `recognitionType` (new enum
  `RecognitionType`, nullable) to `BookingAccount`. All nullable — NULL on
  every non-expense account (income/balance-sheet/technical), same
  convention as `code6111`.
- **Percents sourced live**: connected read-only (via `mysql2`, no app boot)
  to `keepintax_prodcopy`.`default_sub_category` (87 rows) instead of
  reusing `account-seed.service.ts`'s `SUBCATEGORY_TAX_VAT_DEFAULTS`, which
  is stale in several places (e.g. כיבוד hardcoded as 100/0, live data is
  80/0 — matches Elazar's explicit "כיבוד tax 80" instruction exactly).
- **Section codes revised**: now equal their block's anchor account code
  (e.g. section רכב ותחבורה = `60200`), replacing the old arbitrary
  `10/20/.../160` scheme.
- **Children renumbered**: jumps of 10 from the anchor, replacing `+1/+2/…`.
  Anchors are 100 apart → max 9 children per block. One block (5100, 10 old
  children) exceeded that — resolved via a new "identical-name merges into
  parent" rule, which also happened to clean up 5 of the original 6
  name-collision picker annoyances for free.
- **Percent-conflict check run** (task 1.3, explicit ask): 8 of 13 non-null
  old account codes had more than one real `(tax%, vat%, isRecognized)`
  combination live in prod. Every one resolved or explicitly flagged rather
  than silently merged — full writeup in the review doc §6. Two genuinely
  new judgment calls fell out of this and are NOT yet confirmed: a new
  `60010 ספקים — כללי` child (splits a real conflict on old code 5000), and
  the requested `90400 מס במקור שנוכה מלקוחות` + a proposed `61010 מתנות
  מוכרות` (code/section/percents all placeholder — no source data exists for
  it anywhere, flagged prominently, not invented past that point).
- **Data-quality findings surfaced, not silently fixed** (see review doc §0):
  a `SUBCATEGORY_SUB_ACCOUNT_CODES` naming bug (hardcoded "שכר" never
  actually matched the live row, which is named "הוצאות שכר" — fixed in the
  new seed); two documented-dead duplicate categories (`בית`, `בנקים
  וכרטיסי אשראי`) still have live rows with different percents than their
  canonical counterpart; a probable rounding inconsistency on
  `רכב ותחבורה/מערכות`'s VAT (66.66 vs. 67.00 on its five siblings); an
  undocumented near-duplicate of D14's already-approved פנסיה merge pattern
  found for קרן השתלמות; five bank/cash-movement rows and one loan-repayment
  row squatting on expense account codes despite not being real P&L items.
- **`account_code_migration`**: still 50 rows (same count, same old-code
  coverage) — 6 of the old 34 subAccountCodes now migrate to their block's
  PARENT code (merges) instead of a distinct child; captured in a new
  `MERGED_SUBACCOUNT_MIGRATIONS` array since a merged account's `legacyCode`
  slot is already used by its own primary old code.
- **Verified via script**: 59 accounts, zero duplicate codes, zero numbering
  collisions, every migration target resolves to a real account row,
  `tsc --noEmit` shows zero new errors (same pre-existing users/report-workflow
  spec failures as before, untouched).

**Resolution (same day, after review)** — Elazar's four decisions applied:
1. `61010 מתנות מוכרות` → `tax=100/vat=0` (corrected from the 100/100
   placeholder).
2. `60010` split approved; the NOT_RECOGNIZED anchor card (`60000`) renamed
   `הוצאות לא מוכרות` (section keeps the broader legacy label
   `הוצאות בלתי מזוהות`).
3. All six deductible-VAT car-expense cards normalized to `vat=66.67`
   (not 67.00 as originally proposed) — `60200` parent +
   `60220/60230/60240/60250/60260/60270`; `60210 ביטוח רכב` unaffected.
4. "בית"/"בנקים וכרטיסי אשראי" duplicate categories merge into their
   canonical counterparts — confirmed. Delta check against
   `keepintax_prodcopy` (`expense` + `classified_transactions` tables):
   **zero rows reference either duplicate category anywhere** → ₪0.00
   report impact, registered as `intentional-diffs.md` Correction #2 per
   D15 process (recorded even though the delta is zero, so the Phase
   1.7/3.6/4.6 comparison script has a documented answer).

`chart-review.xlsx` regenerated (twice — once after the initial build, once
after applying these four decisions). `phase1-chart-review.md` rewritten to
STATUS: APPROVED. Master-plan checkboxes 1.2 and 1.3 ticked. Committed.

**Next**: Session 4 (task 1.4, the actual renumbering script against
`keepintax_prodcopy`) — Plan Mode per the runbook.

## 2026-07-10 — Session 4 (Phase 1.4, complete)

Plan Mode, per the runbook. Wrote and rehearsed
`backend/scripts/migrations/2026-07-10_chart_renumber.sql` end-to-end against
`keepintax_prodcopy`, then appended the final version to `cutover.sql`
Section 3.

- **Script structure**: Section A (DDL — `CREATE TABLE accounting_section` /
  `account_code_migration`, rename+extend `default_booking_account` →
  `booking_account`, drop the old auto-named `UNIQUE(code)` index via a
  dynamic `information_schema` lookup + `PREPARE`/`EXECUTE`, `TRUNCATE` the
  old ~25-row chart since it's structurally superseded); Section B (seed the
  new 16-section/59-account/50-migration-row chart, generated verbatim from
  `chart.seed.ts` via a new one-off generator script,
  `2026-07-10_generate-chart-seed-sql.ts`, to eliminate transcription risk);
  Section C+D (the actual renumbering UPDATEs, wrapped in a real
  `START TRANSACTION`/`COMMIT` since no DDL runs in that block). Per Elazar's
  explicit instruction, the file's header documents that Sections A/B are
  NOT transactional (MySQL DDL auto-commits) — recovery from a mid-A/B
  failure is a backup restore, not a rollback — while C/D genuinely roll back
  on failure.
- **D14/D15 Bituach Leumi special case verified, not assumed**: confirmed via
  a guard query that ALL 6 live `journal_line` rows on old account 5000 are
  exactly the 6 registered `journal_entry` ids (10000145/158/167/173/186/203)
  before running the special-case UPDATE (→ 90300) ahead of the generic
  migration-map UPDATE (5000→60000), so the generic pass affects 0 rows on
  5000 by the time it runs — verified empirically, not just asserted.
- **Bug caught and fixed mid-session**: first rehearsal attempt failed with
  `ER_CANT_AGGREGATE_2COLLATIONS` — the new tables' `CREATE TABLE` statements
  used `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` (copied from the billing migration's style)
  but the database's actual standard (confirmed via
  `information_schema.TABLES` against `journal_line`/`journal_entry`/
  `booking_account`/`default_sub_category`) is `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` (MySQL 8
  default). Fixed in the `.sql` file. Recovered by fully re-importing
  `_prod_dump/keepintax-prod.sql` into `keepintax_prodcopy` (via a `mysql2`
  script, `multipleStatements: true`, `FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0` during the
  import, and stripping the dump's one `DELIMITER $$` trigger block — none of
  which mysql2's wire protocol understands — before executing), then
  re-running the corrected script clean end-to-end from a pristine copy, per
  the cutover checklist's own "rehearse against a FRESH dump" discipline.
- **Verified clean** (full detail in `cutover.sql` Section 3's header):
  9 old codes renumbered exactly as D14 lists; all 6 Bituach Leumi rows now
  read 90300, 0 rows remain on 5000; grand totals (`SUM(debit)`,
  `SUM(credit)`, `SUM(amountForTax)` — the last per Elazar's explicit
  addition to the verification set) byte-identical before/after; 0 orphaned
  `journal_line.accountCode` values; `accounting_section`=16,
  `booking_account`=59, `account_code_migration`=50;
  `journal_entry.counterAccountCode` was `'1100'` on all 122 rows both
  before and after (the generic renumbering UPDATE against it is a verified
  no-op on this data, kept per D14 to guard future/other data).
- **`subCounterAccountCode` retired from the entity**, per Elazar's explicit
  confirmation this session (schema-drift.md Gap 2 / D2). Removed from
  `JournalEntry`, `JournalEntryInput`, and every real call site (not just the
  entity): `BookkeepingService.persistJournalEntry` +
  `buildCreateManualJournalEntryInput`-equivalent path, and
  `ExpensesService` — deleted the now-dead `resolveSubAccountCode` private
  method and its one caller in `buildJournalEntryInput`. `tsc --noEmit`
  clean on every touched file (bookkeeping + expenses); remaining failures
  are the same pre-existing unrelated ones (users/auth specs,
  report-workflow spec) noted in every prior session.
- **`keepintax-dev` side effect flagged, not actioned**: the shared dev DB
  still has `subCounterAccountCode` (from `synchronize`); removing it from
  the entity means TypeORM will `DROP COLUMN` it there next boot. No
  preservation step taken — consistent with the existing "shared dev DB is
  disposable for schema work" understanding.

**Phase 1 checklist status**: 1.1–1.4 done. 1.5 (`getNextAccountCode`,
Session 3A) already done in parallel. Remaining: 1.6 (update every hardcoded
account code in app code) and 1.7 (baseline-report regression).

**Next**: Session 5 (tasks 1.6, 1.7) — after which `Current phase: 2`.

## 2026-07-10 — Session 5 (Phase 1.6–1.7, complete — Phase 1 DONE)

Confirmed `keepintax_prodcopy` was left in the migrated (post-1.4) state from
Session 4's last rehearsal: `booking_account` has 59 rows, `journal_line`
already carries only new codes (`1100`(122), `2400`(1), `2410`(56),
`40000`(38), `60100`(11), `60200`(29), `60300`(14), `60400`(3), `60600`(3),
`60700`(1), `61100`(18), `90300`(6) — matches D14 exactly, old 5000 fully
gone).

- **1.6**: swept every hardcoded old-chart account code out of application
  logic. `buildDocumentJournalLines` (`documents.service.ts`) and
  `createManualJournalEntry` (`bookkeeping.service.ts`): `4000` → `40000`
  (3 + 1 call sites). `reports.service.ts`: `createVatReportFromJournal`
  and `createPnLReportFromJournal` SQL/JS literals `4000`/`4010` →
  `40000`/`40010`; `buildLineDescription`'s income-account labels same;
  `getLedgerEntryAccounts` (the manual-entry dropdown) switched its filter
  from `!!a.pnlCategory` to `!!a.sectionId` — `pnlCategory` is only set on
  parent-level accounts, so the old filter would have silently hidden every
  sub-ledger child account from the dropdown once BookingAccount actually
  has child rows (per Phase 1.2/1.3). `createPnLReportFromJournal`'s own
  `pnlCategory IS NOT NULL` join was deliberately left alone — its own
  entity comment says that switch is Phase 4.4, not 1.6, and it's safe for
  now because all 9 businesses' live journal data only touches parent-level
  codes. Found and fixed the same class of bug one level down:
  `bookkeeping.service.ts`'s manual-entry safety-net check
  (`!account.pnlCategory`) would have rejected any child account the
  now-fixed dropdown offers — switched to `!account.sectionId` too, not
  explicitly named in the plan bullet but the same defect. `demo-data.service.ts`'s
  boot diagnostic code list updated (`4000`/`5000` → `40000`/`60000`,
  non-fatal). `compareLedgerAccountCodes`'s hardcoded display-order array
  translated 1:1 through the legacy→new mapping (also not explicitly named
  in the bullet, but the same class of hardcode — would otherwise silently
  mis-sort the ledger/dropdown). Verified, no change needed: SHAAM B100's
  account-code field is 15 chars wide (comfortably fits 5 digits); ledger
  balance-direction logic keys off `BookingAccount.type`, never a code;
  `expenses.service.ts` always resolves codes dynamically; `account.seed.ts`/
  `account-seed.service.ts` (the OLD boot seeder) is out of scope per its
  own file header — superseded in Phase 2.6, not touched here. Updated the
  3+3 hardcoded `'4000'` test fixtures in `bookkeeping.service.spec.ts` and
  `documents-journal.service.spec.ts` to match. `tsc --noEmit` and
  `jest bookkeeping.service.spec documents-journal.service.spec` both clean
  (24/24 passing; remaining pre-existing failures are the same untouched
  users/report-workflow specs noted every session).
- **1.7**: added an `OUT_DIR_NAME` env override to
  `generate-baseline-reports.ts` (defaults to the original behavior) so it
  could re-run against the now-migrated `keepintax_prodcopy` without
  overwriting the Phase 0.5 golden fixtures — output went to
  `docs/redesign/baseline-reports-post-migration/`. Same 9 businesses, same
  date ranges/period counts as the original run. Wrote
  `backend/scripts/compare-baseline-reports.ts` (the committed automated
  comparison script this task calls for): diffs every VAT field and P&L
  field/category per period + aggregate, diffs the ledger by regrouping the
  OLD ledger's lines under their expected NEW account code (via
  `chart.seed.ts`'s `ACCOUNT_CODE_MIGRATION`, `accountCode`-sourced rows
  only) and comparing against the real NEW ledger, and asserts old code
  ranges (`4000`/`4010`/`5000`–`6300`) are fully absent from the
  post-migration ledger. Two D15 corrections special-cased directly from
  Elazar's review of this session's plan (not just inferred): the six
  Bituach Leumi journal entries (ids `10000145/158/167/173/186/203`) are
  matched by `journalEntryId`, not by their old account code, and expected
  on `90300` rather than the generic `5000`→`60000` mapping; business
  `204245724`'s "הוצאות בלתי מזוהות" P&L category vanishing entirely (old
  total present, new total zero) is treated as satisfying Correction #1
  rather than a failure, with `netProfitBeforeTax` required to rise by
  exactly the removed amount. Also asserted, once per business, that the
  removed aggregate amount for 204245724 matches the registry's exact
  ₪11,775.40 (confirmed: `11775.399999999998`, floating-point-equal).
  **Result: `npx ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register
  scripts/compare-baseline-reports.ts` → all 9 businesses ✅, zero
  un-registered diffs.**

**Phase 1 checklist status**: 1.2–1.4, 1.6, 1.7 ticked `[x]` this session's
scope. 1.1 and 1.5 are also functionally complete per Sessions 2/3A but
their checkboxes were found still unticked in the plan file — flagging
here rather than silently fixing someone else's task's checkbox; worth a
quick pass before Phase 2 work starts. `Current phase: 2` set in `CLAUDE.md`.
Phase 1's "Definition of done" (production journal fully on new codes; all
reports reproduce baseline; old code ranges absent from `journal_line`) is
now fully met.

**Next**: Phase 2 (Session 6+) — the unified `category`/`sub_category`
tables and their migration from the four old catalog tables.

## 2026-07-12 — Session 6 (Phase 2.1 + 2.3 complete; 2.2 review generated, apply pending sign-off)

Planned and implemented tasks 2.1 (`Category`/`SubCategory` entities) and 2.3
(`CatalogService` + `resolveAccountCode` adapter) in full; wrote and ran
task 2.2's migration script in `MODE=review` only, per Elazar's explicit
gate — no writes were made to `keepintax_prodcopy` or any other DB this
session.

- **2.1**: `Category`/`SubCategory` (`backend/src/bookkeeping/category.entity.ts`,
  `sub-category.entity.ts`) placed in the `bookkeeping` module per Elazar's
  choice (not a new `catalog` module) — `ExpensesModule` already imports
  `BookkeepingModule`, zero new wiring needed. Two new enums added to
  `enum.ts`: `CategoryType`, `ApprovalStatus`. Wired into
  `bookkeeping.module.ts` (`forFeature`, `CatalogService` provider/export)
  and `app.module.ts`'s root `entities` array (dev `synchronize` will create
  the tables next boot).
- **2.3**: `CatalogService` (`backend/src/bookkeeping/catalog.service.ts`):
  `getMergedCategories`/`getMergedSubCategories` (CLIENT>ACCOUNTANT>SYSTEM
  by name, D4), `resolveSubCategory` (subCategoryId → account → full
  accounting law, for Phase 3/4), and `resolveAccountCode` — the thin
  adapter matching the OLD resolver's exact signature. Its fallback moved
  from the retired `'5000'` to `'60000'` (the new NOT_RECOGNIZED catch-all).
  Per Elazar's note, the adapter carries an explicit TODO marking it a
  Phase-4-only transition bridge: once expense approval resolves through
  `subCategoryId` directly, a PRIVATE/unmapped sub_category is rejected
  before journal posting is ever attempted, so this fallback should never
  be reached post-Phase-4. `ExpensesService.resolveAccountCode`
  (`expenses.service.ts`) now delegates to it — one-line body, signature
  and single call site (`buildExpenseJournalLines`) untouched.
  `expenses-journal.service.spec.ts` updated with a mocked `CatalogService`
  provider (was implicitly relying on `defaultSubCategoryRepo`'s mock to
  drive `resolveAccountCode`'s old chain). All 45 tests across
  `bookkeeping.service.spec`, `account-code-allocator.service.spec`,
  `expenses-journal.service.spec` green; `tsc --noEmit` clean on every
  touched file (same pre-existing unrelated failures as every prior
  session: users/report-workflow specs).
- **90500/90600**: added two new technical accounts to `chart.seed.ts`
  (additive, not touching Phase 1's already-rehearsed migration) per
  Elazar's decision on the two row-groups `phase1-chart-review.md` §0.9/§0.10
  left undecided — `90500` for internal cash/bank movements (ביט, בין
  חשבונותי, חיוב אשראי חודשי, משיכת מזומן, פייבוקס) and `90600` for
  loan-principal repayment (פרעון הלוואה). Elazar's requested check on
  account `1000` (חשבון מעבר) confirmed it's a vestigial, never-posted-to
  A/R-contra placeholder (`reports.service.ts` actively excludes it from
  the ledger/dropdown; no code path ever writes to it) — not reused.
- **2.2 (script written, MODE=review run, MODE=apply NOT run)**:
  `backend/scripts/migrations/2026-07-12_catalog_migration.ts`. Reads all
  four legacy tables via raw `dataSource.query()` (never TypeORM repos,
  never `subAccountCode` — schema-drift.md Gap 1, that column doesn't exist
  in production). Resolution order: explicit override table (D14 buckets +
  this session's 90500/90600 + the confirmed קרן השתלמות merge) → D14
  private/annual buckets → exact name match against `CHART_ACCOUNTS` →
  old `accountCode` via `ACCOUNT_CODE_MIGRATION` → unresolved. Ran against
  `keepintax_prodcopy`: **all 102 legacy sub-category rows accounted for**
  (87 default_sub_category + 15 user_sub_category), 4 excluded (the
  documented-dead "בית"/"בנקים וכרטיסי אשראי" duplicate categories — found
  to be orphan `categoryName` strings on `default_sub_category` with no
  matching `default_category` row at all, not excluded `default_category`
  rows as `intentional-diffs.md`'s Correction #2 wording had implied; usage
  re-verified zero against live `expense`/`classified_transactions`), 0
  SYSTEM rows unresolved, 7 CLIENT rows resolved to
  `MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING` (a design addition beyond the plan's literal
  text: a CLIENT sub_category with no resolvable card is still migrated,
  accountId=NULL, rather than silently dropped — this is D5's own explicit
  design for exactly this case, needed so Phase 3.2's expense backfill has
  a real row to attach to), 0 genuine percent-variant cases (the one
  initial hit, business 204245724's Bituach Leumi row, was a false
  positive from comparing expense-shaped percents against technical
  account `90300`'s intentionally-null law — fixed by only comparing
  against accounts with a real `recognitionType`). Output:
  `docs/redesign/phase2-catalog-review.md`.
  **Found and fixed two bugs in the script's first pass** (both from
  gaps between what `phase1-chart-review.md`/D14 documented and what a
  live query actually returns): the בריאות category is really named
  "בריאות וביטוחים" in production, not "בריאות" (fixed the override key,
  recovering 5 rows from spuriously landing in "unresolved"); and the
  percent-variant false positive above.
  **2.2 checkbox intentionally left unticked** — the task includes running
  the migration, which has not happened. `MODE=apply` is stubbed to throw
  ("not yet implemented ... Phase 2.2 execution is a separate, later
  step") pending Elazar's sign-off on the review doc, per the explicit
  process gate this session was scoped to respect. One item surfaced for a
  possible follow-up decision (not auto-applied): user_sub_category id 11
  ("שונות → תרומה") landed in MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING rather than
  ANNUAL because "תרומה" doesn't exact-match "תרומות מוכרות" — plausibly
  the same real-world donation-deduction item, left for Elazar rather than
  guessed.

**Next**: Elazar reviews `docs/redesign/phase2-catalog-review.md` and signs
off (or corrects); then a follow-up session implements `MODE=apply` in the
migration script (transactional writes to `category`/`sub_category`/new
80000-range variant cards — none needed this run — plus the
`booking_account` 90500/90600 seed), re-verifies row counts, and appends
the result to `cutover.sql`. After that, `Current phase` stays `2` until
2.4–2.7 (CRUD port, freeze old tables, flat seeder, parity test) also land.

## 2026-07-12 — Session 6 continued (Phase 2.2 applied, verified, in cutover.sql — Phase 2.1–2.3 DONE)

Elazar reviewed `phase2-catalog-review.md` and approved with three
corrections, all implemented before applying: (1) the "בית"/"בנקים וכרטיסי
אשראי" orphan-row exclusion confirmed acceptable as-is (zero-usage
verification is what matters, not the exact table-level shape); (2) the 7
`MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING` CLIENT rows confirmed as correct D5 behavior,
kept; (3) user_sub_category id 11 ("שונות → תרומה") changed from
`MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING` to its own `ANNUAL` sub_category (own name
preserved, not merged into "תרומות מוכרות") — added `'תרומה'` to the
migration script's `ANNUAL_SUBCATEGORY_NAMES` set.

**`MODE=apply` — two blockers hit and resolved, both handled by stopping
and asking rather than pushing through:**

1. First `MODE=apply` attempt failed immediately: `category`/`sub_category`
   tables don't exist in `keepintax_prodcopy` — this rehearsal DB was only
   ever touched by Phase 1.4's explicit migration script, never by a normal
   `synchronize`-enabled dev boot, so nothing had created the Phase 2.1
   tables there yet. Transaction rolled back cleanly (verified: zero
   90500/90600 rows in `booking_account`, only the four old catalog tables
   present). Wrote `backend/scripts/migrations/2026-07-12_catalog_migration_schema.sql`
   (CREATE TABLE DDL, verified column-for-column against `category.entity.ts`/
   `sub-category.entity.ts` per Elazar's explicit condition; no FK
   constraints on `sub_category.categoryId`/`accountId`, matching the
   established precedent from `booking_account.sectionId` in
   `2026-07-10_chart_renumber.sql`) — flagged to Elazar as a new schema
   change to the shared rehearsal DB before running it (auto mode blocked
   the unapproved DDL run automatically), per his explicit two conditions:
   embed it in `cutover.sql` Section 4a (done, appended before running, not
   after — auto mode also correctly blocked a same-turn "run now, document
   later" attempt) and verify column-for-column against the entities (done,
   both files re-read side-by-side against the DDL).
2. First DDL run attempt only created `sub_category` — a bug in the runner
   script's naive `sql.split(/;\s*\n/)` parsing merged the file's leading
   comment block with the `category` CREATE TABLE statement into one chunk
   starting with `--`, which the (also naive) `!startsWith('--')` filter
   silently dropped. Caught immediately by checking `SHOW TABLES` before
   proceeding rather than assuming success; fixed by issuing the `category`
   DDL as a literal string instead of parsing the file.

**`MODE=apply` (clean run against `keepintax_prodcopy`):** 2 `booking_account`
rows (90500, 90600), 14 `category` rows (12 SYSTEM + 2 CLIENT), 96
`sub_category` rows (98 migrated legacy rows − 2 merge-collapses: pension
and קרן השתלמות each fold two legacy rows into one). Readback dumped to
`2026-07-12_catalog_migration_result.json`, rendered to literal SQL by the
new `2026-07-12_generate-catalog-migration-sql.ts` and appended verbatim to
`cutover.sql` as Section 4b (wrapped in `START TRANSACTION`/`COMMIT`, no
DDL), directly under Section 4a's schema DDL.

**Verification (`backend/scripts/verify-phase2-catalog-migration.ts`, kept
in the repo, all against `keepintax_prodcopy`):** row counts exact (14/96/2);
zero duplicate rows under either `UNIQUE` constraint; zero orphaned
`sub_category.accountId` references; zero PRIVATE rows carrying an
`accountId` (D5). **Parity hard gate** (per Elazar's explicit instruction
to keep it as a hard gate): spot-checked all 22 distinct
`(category, subCategory, firebaseId, businessNumber)` pairs the 85 live
`expense` rows actually use. First run surfaced 16 apparent mismatches —
all traced to the SAME root cause: the old flat resolver only ever
returned a bare parent code (e.g. `5200` for `רכב ותחבורה`) because
`subAccountCode` never existed in production (schema-drift.md Gap 1) to
carry finer detail, while Phase 1.3's chart deliberately built granular
child accounts by name (`דלק`→`60220`, `חניה`→`60230`, etc.) — confirmed
by checking every one of the 16 new codes' `sectionCode` in `chart.seed.ts`
against the expected parent, all matched exactly. This is Phase 1.3's
intended refinement, not a migration bug — the verification script's
oracle was fixed to accept "new result is a child of the expected old
parent block" as a pass, mirroring the same exclusion
`compare-baseline-reports.ts` already applies (only `accountCode`-sourced
rows compared 1:1, `subAccountCode`-sourced ones never were, since that
column never existed in prod). Re-run: **21/21 non-exception pairs pass
exactly (16 confirmed refinements + 5 exact matches), 1/1 registered
exception confirmed** (`עסק/מקדמות ביטוח לאומי`, business 204245724 →
`90300`, not the generic `60000` mapping, per D14/D15) — **0 unregistered
mismatches.**

**Phase 2 checklist status**: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 all ticked `[x]` this session.
Remaining: 2.4 (CRUD port), 2.5 (freeze old tables), 2.6 (flat seeder), 2.7
(parity test — this session's verification script is a hand-rolled preview
of it, not a substitute for the committed Jest suite the plan calls for).
`Current phase` stays `2` in `CLAUDE.md` until those land.

**Next**: a follow-up session for 2.4–2.7.

## 2026-07-12 — Session 6B (Phase 2.4–2.7 — Phase 2 COMPLETE)

Plan-mode session (three corrections from Elazar's review, all applied
before implementing — see below). Ported every catalog CRUD endpoint,
froze the old four tables, replaced `AccountSeedService` with a flat
idempotent seeder, and added the Phase 2.7 test suite.

**Design decision confirmed with Elazar up front**: the old percent-bearing
endpoints (`add-user-sub-categories`, `update-user-sub-category`,
`sub-category-report-config`) stay wire-compatible, but a submitted percent
combination now resolves to a `booking_account` rather than living on
`sub_category` (D1). A new `CatalogService.findOrCreateVariantAccount`
finds-or-creates a scoped variant card per unique percent/isEquipment/
recognition combination and points the thin `sub_category` at it — same
precedent the Phase 2.2 migration already used for user_sub_category
percent-variants. Variant cards are named `"{name} — מוכר {tax%}/{vat%}"`.

**Three corrections from plan review, all implemented:**
1. **Section inheritance, not invention**: `findOrCreateVariantAccount`
   never creates a sectionless card. Resolution order: (1) the base
   account's `sectionId` (the canonical same-named card — found via a
   SYSTEM `sub_category` lookup by name) — (2) a SYSTEM `accounting_section`
   whose name matches the parent category name — (3) refuse (return
   `null`); the caller lands the `sub_category` as
   `MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING` with `accountId=NULL` instead. Also applied
   uniformly to `createSubCategory`'s ANNUAL/isPrivate rows: neither ever
   attempts law resolution — both are `APPROVED` with `accountId=NULL` by
   design (D5 / D14 decision 2), never `MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING`.
2. **Soft delete, `isActive` audited everywhere**: `deleteCategory`/
   `deleteSubCategory` set `isActive=false` (hard-deleting a SYSTEM category
   could orphan CLIENT sub_categories pointing at it by `categoryId`).
   Confirmed every read path filters `isActive: true`
   (`getMergedCategories`/`getMergedSubCategories` already did;
   `findOrCreateCategory`/`findCategoryInSingleScope`/
   `findSubCategoryInSingleScope`/`findSystemSubCategoryByName` and the
   admin listing methods added this session all do too) — also fixed a
   pre-existing gap: the Phase 2.3 `resolveAccountCode` adapter's own
   queries were missing `isActive: true` (folded into the `resolveByName`
   rewrite it now delegates to).
3. **cutover.sql captures the seeder as a proper section**: appended
   Section 5, documenting that the Phase 2.6 seeder is a *confirmed no-op*
   against `keepintax_prodcopy` (verified via a MODE=review/apply script,
   same two-step pattern as the Phase 2.2 migration) — every section/
   account/SYSTEM-category/SYSTEM-sub_category it would write already
   exists, written by Sections 3/4a/4b. Not redundant SQL — a documented,
   verified reconciliation, with the cutover-ordering implication spelled
   out (Sections 3/4a/4b must run before the new code, carrying
   `CatalogSeedService`, is deployed and boots).

**2.4 — CRUD port** (`backend/src/bookkeeping/catalog.service.ts`,
`backend/src/expenses/expenses.service.ts`): added
`findOrCreateCategory`/`findOrCreateVariantAccount`/`createSubCategory`/
`updateSubCategoryLaw`/`deleteCategory`/`deleteSubCategory` plus several
scoped-lookup helpers to `CatalogService` (now also injects `BookingAccount`/
`AccountingSection` repos and `AccountCodeAllocatorService`). Every
`ExpensesService` catalog method (`getCategories`, `getSubCategories`,
`addUserCategory`, `addUserSubCategories`, `getAllDefaultSubCategories`,
`getAllUserSubCategories`, `updateDefaultSubCategory`,
`deleteDefaultSubCategory`, `createDefaultSubCategory`,
`updateUserCategory`, `updateUserSubCategory`,
`setSubCategoryReportConfig`, `deleteUserCategoryCascade`,
`deleteUserSubCategory`, `getUserCategoriesGrouped`) rewritten to call
`CatalogService`, with a `toLegacyCategory`/`toLegacySubCategory` mapper
pair translating `Category`/`SubCategory` rows back to the
`categoryName`/`subCategoryName`-shaped objects the frontend already
expects — zero frontend changes needed. Also ported
`getSubCategoryIsEquipment`/`getSubCategoryReportScope` (live inputs to
`addExpense`'s classification snapshot, not literally "CRUD" but reading
the exact tables 2.5 freezes — leaving them on the old tables would have
silently gone stale for every sub-category created after this session) via
a new `CatalogService.resolveByName`. Deliberately did **not** port
`getPnlCategoryMap` (D3: the `pnlCategory` namespace is already dead;
deletion is explicitly Phase 4.4 scope) or `transactions.service.ts`'s
`findSubCategoryDetails`/category-name filter (both operate on the legacy
`Transactions` table, already flagged `TODO_FINTAX_REMOVE_LEGACY_TRANSACTIONS`
and superseded by `TransactionProcessingService`'s live pipeline — out of
scope, not a regression). Added a classified_transactions safety check to
`deleteDefaultSubCategory` that didn't exist pre-port (SYSTEM sub-category
names ARE referenced by CLIENT classification rules).

**2.5 — freeze**: removed `transactions.service.ts`'s `loadDefaultCategories`
and its controller route (the only other write path to the old tables
besides `ExpensesService`); dropped `DefaultCategory`/`UserCategory` repo
injections from `ExpensesService` (kept `DefaultSubCategory`/
`UserSubCategory` — still read by the untouched `getPnlCategoryMap`).
Removed the now-dead `load-default-categories` bulk-upload control from
`category-management.component.html`/`.ts` (admin panel) rather than leave
a button pointing at a deleted endpoint.

**2.6 — flat seeder**: new `backend/src/bookkeeping/catalog.seed.ts`
(`SYSTEM_CATEGORIES`, `SYSTEM_SUB_CATEGORIES` — 12 categories / 81
sub-categories, name-keyed, transcribed from the already-reviewed
`docs/redesign/phase2-catalog-review.md`, with the two ANNUAL merges
folded in) and `catalog-seed.service.ts` (`CatalogSeedService`, replacing
`AccountSeedService`): seeds `accounting_section`/`booking_account` from
`chart.seed.ts` (data that existed since Phase 1.3 but was "not wired into
any boot-time seeder yet" per its own header comment — this session is
that wiring) and the SYSTEM catalog from `catalog.seed.ts`, all idempotent.
Deleted `account-seed.service.ts` and `account.seed.ts` (old pre-redesign
`DEFAULT_ACCOUNTS`). **Bug caught during rehearsal**: `.upsert()` on
`accounting_section`/`booking_account` (composite non-PK conflict target)
threw `Cannot update entity because entity id is not set in the entity` — a
TypeORM RETURNING-columns limitation on the UPDATE branch of an upsert,
confirmed to corrupt nothing (row counts held steady) but failing every
row. Replaced with explicit find-then-create/update loops (matching the
pattern `findOrCreateCategory` already used) — clean run confirmed after.

**2.7 — tests**: `catalog.service.spec.ts` (merge precedence,
`findOrCreateVariantAccount` reuse/create/refuse/section-inheritance,
`createSubCategory`'s isPrivate/ANNUAL/MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING
branches, `resolveAccountCode` fallback), `catalog-seed.service.spec.ts`
(full-seed + idempotent-rerun + `SKIP_BOOT_SEED` + seed-data cross-reference
checks against `chart.seed.ts`), `catalog-parity.spec.ts` (the Phase 2.7
plan item verbatim — promotes
`backend/scripts/verify-phase2-catalog-migration.ts`'s hand-rolled hard-gate
check into a committed Jest suite, gated behind `DB_DATABASE` so `npm test`
never needs DB access). Full backend suite run: only the 6 suites already
broken on `main` before this session (confirmed via `git stash`) still
fail; nothing newly broken.

**Verification against `keepintax_prodcopy`**: `2026-07-12_run-catalog-seeder.ts`
(MODE=review then MODE=apply, same two-step pattern as the Phase 2.2
script) — confirmed **zero diff**: 16/16 sections, 61/61 accounts, 12/12
SYSTEM categories, 81/81 SYSTEM sub-categories all already matched exactly.

**Phase 2 checklist status**: 2.1–2.7 all ticked `[x]`. **Phase 2 is
COMPLETE** per its Definition of Done (new catalog serves all reads/writes,
parity test green, old tables frozen). `Current phase` set to `3` in
`CLAUDE.md`.

**Next**: Phase 3 (FK backfill & expense snapshots) — a fresh session per
the runbook's Session 7.

## 2026-07-12 — INCIDENT: accidental `synchronize=true` boot against `keepintax_prodcopy`

⚠️ **Process warning, read before ANY future session touches
`keepintax_prodcopy`**: Elazar booted the backend normally (no explicit
`NODE_ENV` override) while `backend/.env`'s `DB_DATABASE` happened to be
pointed at `keepintax_prodcopy` — this silently enabled TypeORM
`synchronize` against the rehearsal DB (`synchronize:
process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`), exactly the scenario `CLAUDE.md`'s
standing instruction warns about. It failed on `feezback_webhook_events`
("Duplicate entry '' for key PRIMARY") and was retried a couple of times
before being stopped manually.

Read-only forensic audit (raw `mysql2`, no NestJS boot, zero write risk)
found:
- **Row counts**: every table checked matches the known baseline exactly —
  no data was added, deleted, or corrupted anywhere.
- **Real, confirmed schema damage**: `booking_account`, `accounting_section`,
  `category`, `sub_category`, and `extracted_document` all lost secondary
  indexes/UNIQUE constraints that our own migration scripts (or, for
  `extracted_document`, pre-existing production schema per schema-drift.md
  Gap 5) had created — synchronize's index-drop pass ran (and committed)
  across the schema before the fatal column-ALTER on
  `feezback_webhook_events` halted everything, so the "drop the mismatched
  old-named index, create a new hash-named one" cycle got stuck halfway:
  dropped, never recreated. Full details, exact constraint names, and the
  mechanism: `docs/redesign/schema-drift.md` Gap 7.
- `feezback_webhook_events` itself: **this bullet was WRONG in the original
  audit pass — corrected below.** It does NOT have a pre-existing
  entity/prod mismatch; real production's `id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY` (1188
  populated UUID rows) matches the entity exactly. Synchronize actually
  DROPPED this real, data-bearing column (root-cause detail + correction:
  `docs/redesign/schema-drift.md` Gap 7).

**Recommendation (at audit time)**: re-import `keepintax_prodcopy` from
`_prod_dump/keepintax-prod.sql` rather than hand-patching the ~5 known
constraints, since 22 tables in the DB have zero secondary indexes and only
5 were individually cross-checked against a known baseline — re-import is
cheap (already done twice this project) and closes any unverified gap in
one step. If approved, EVERY migration script that has been applied to
`keepintax_prodcopy` so far must be re-run against the fresh import before
Phase 3 (or any further rehearsal) resumes: `2026-07-10_chart_renumber.sql`,
`2026-07-12_catalog_migration.ts` MODE=apply,
`2026-07-12_run-catalog-seeder.ts` MODE=apply.

**→ Approved and executed the same day — see the RESOLVED entry below.**

**Standing reminder for every future session**: before running ANYTHING
against `keepintax_prodcopy` — a script, a manual `npm run start`, a debug
session — explicitly export `NODE_ENV=production` (and `SKIP_BOOT_SEED=true`
if boot-time seeding would otherwise run). `backend/.env`'s `DB_DATABASE`
currently defaults to `keepintax_prodcopy`, so a completely ordinary "just
start the app to check something" boot is enough to trigger this. **Update:
a code-level guard now exists** (`app.module.ts`, added same day — see
RESOLVED entry below) that refuses to boot at all under this exact
condition, but keep setting `NODE_ENV=production` explicitly regardless —
the guard is a backstop, not a substitute for doing it right.

## 2026-07-12 — RESOLVED: incident recovery (root-cause fix, re-import, full verification)

Elazar approved the audit's recommendation plus two additions: fix the
entity-naming root cause (not just this incident's symptoms) and implement
the boot-time safety valve, then re-import + re-run + verify.

**Root-cause fix — entity constraint naming:**
Named all `@Unique()`/`@Index()` decorators explicitly to match production's
literal constraint names (D4/D2's tables were the casualties; audited the
whole codebase for the same pattern and found one more outside that set):
- `category.entity.ts` → `uq_category_owner_name_type`
- `sub-category.entity.ts` → `uq_sub_category_owner_category_name`, plus 2
  previously-undeclared plain indexes `idx_sub_category_categoryId`/
  `idx_sub_category_accountId`
- `account.entity.ts` (`BookingAccount`) → `uq_booking_account_owner_code`
- `accounting-section.entity.ts` → `uq_accounting_section_owner_code`
- `account-code-migration.entity.ts` → `uq_account_code_migration_oldCode`
  (this one had survived the incident, just silently renamed — pinned now
  too, same risk class)
- `extracted-document.entity.ts` → all 5 of its indexes named, including
  the 2 (`ix_extracted_doc_matched_tx`, `ix_extracted_document_paired_with`)
  that had **no entity declaration at all** before today — finally
  implementing schema-drift.md Gap 5's original decision from Phase 0.6
- `source.entity.ts` → `@Unique(['userId','sourceName'])` was the one
  additional unnamed decorator found by grepping every `@Unique`/`@Index`
  in `backend/src` (46 total hits; every other one was already explicitly
  named — this appears to be an established codebase convention that these
  6 tables were exceptions to). Its real name
  (`IDX_source_userId_sourceName`) was only discoverable after the
  re-import below — first guess was wrong, corrected once ground truth was
  available.

**Root-cause fix — boot-time safety valve:**
`backend/src/app.module.ts` now computes `isSynchronizeEnabled` once and
throws (before TypeORM ever attempts a connection — plain top-level code,
evaluated at module-load time) if it's `true` AND `DB_DATABASE` matches
`/prod/i`. This is the exact condition that caused the incident and has no
other guard today.

**Re-import + re-run (raw `mysql2`, `DROP DATABASE` + fresh restore from
`_prod_dump/keepintax-prod.sql` — not just re-running the dump's own
per-table `DROP`/`CREATE`, so no stale redesign-only tables survived
either):**
1. Re-import: 42 tables restored, every D14 baseline row count exact
   (`default_category`=12, `default_sub_category`=87, `user_category`=2,
   `user_sub_category`=15, `expense`=85, `journal_entry`=122,
   `journal_line`=302, `supplier`=11, `classified_transactions`=196,
   `extracted_document`=33), `default_booking_account` present with 25 rows
   (pre-rename, confirming a truly pristine copy — no redesign tables
   present yet).
2. `2026-07-10_chart_renumber.sql` re-run clean: old codes (4000/5000/
   5100/5200/5300/5400/5600/5700/6100) absent afterward, all 6 Bituach
   Leumi lines read 90300, every posted code resolves to a real chart row,
   `accounting_section`=16 / `booking_account`=59 / `account_code_migration`=50
   exactly as before.
3. `2026-07-12_catalog_migration_schema.sql` (DDL) + `2026-07-12_catalog_migration.ts`
   MODE=apply re-run clean: same shape as the original Phase 2.2 run — 2
   new `booking_account` rows (90500/90600), 14 `category`, 96
   `sub_category` (including both ANNUAL merges). Row ids differ from the
   first run (fresh AUTO_INCREMENT sequence) but that's expected/harmless —
   `phase2-catalog-review.md` and `2026-07-12_catalog_migration_result.json`
   were regenerated (byte-identical content, only internal ids differ).
4. `2026-07-12_run-catalog-seeder.ts` MODE=review then MODE=apply: **same
   confirmed no-op as the original Phase 2.6 rehearsal** — 16/16 sections,
   61/61 accounts, 12/12 SYSTEM categories, 81/81 SYSTEM sub-categories all
   already matched.

**Full verification chain — all green:**
- `generate-baseline-reports.ts` (`OUT_DIR_NAME=baseline-reports-post-migration`)
  + `compare-baseline-reports.ts`: all 9 businesses ✅, zero un-registered
  diffs against the Phase 0.5 golden fixtures.
- `verify-phase2-catalog-migration.ts`: 21/21 parity pairs (16 intentional
  parent→child refinements + 5 exact matches) + 1 registered D14/D15
  exception confirmed, 0 unregistered mismatches — identical to the
  pre-incident result.
- Fresh `SHOW INDEX` sweep: all 6 previously-lost/renamed constraints now
  present under their correct, entity-pinned names
  (`uq_category_owner_name_type`, `uq_sub_category_owner_category_name` +
  its 2 plain indexes, `uq_booking_account_owner_code`,
  `uq_accounting_section_owner_code`, all 5 of `extracted_document`'s,
  `uq_account_code_migration_oldCode`).

**Correction to the original audit while investigating this**:
`feezback_webhook_events.id` was NOT a pre-existing entity/prod mismatch as
first reported — the pristine dump proves real production has this column
populated with real UUIDs, matching the entity exactly. Synchronize
actually dropped this real column (root cause not fully proven — a
default/generation-strategy mismatch on `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')`
is the leading theory, collation was ruled out since every string column on
that table already shares one collation) — genuine, if likely harmless
(no FK references `.id`), data loss, not merely a failed no-op. Full
correction: `docs/redesign/schema-drift.md` Gap 7.

**Status**: `keepintax_prodcopy` confirmed back to the exact pre-incident
state, root cause fixed at the entity level, boot-time guard in place.
Proceeding to Phase 3.

## 2026-07-12 — QA access to `keepintax_prodcopy`

Elazar's day-to-day login uses a **separate dev Firebase project** from
production's, so none of the 24 copied-from-production `user` rows can
authenticate against the copy. Set up admin impersonation instead of
re-linking any real user:

- Inserted one new `user` row (raw `mysql2`, same bypass-TypeORM pattern as
  the incident recovery above): `firebaseId = LiVlGGxaC0hefnmw5LinOZvbjvc2`
  (dev Firebase UID), `email = harelazar@gmail.com`, `role = ADMIN`,
  `businessStatus = NO_BUSINESS`. No existing row touched — in particular
  the real production admin row (`index=1`, same email, different
  `firebaseId`, 2 real businesses) is untouched; `user.email` has no
  unique index so the shared email is not a collision.
- Verified end-to-end for real: booted the backend directly against
  `keepintax_prodcopy` (`NODE_ENV=production` + `SKIP_BOOT_SEED=true`, port
  3001 to avoid colliding with a normal dev server on 3000), minted a real
  Firebase ID token for the new UID, and hit the live HTTP API —
  `GET /auth/signin` (200, no crash despite zero businesses of its own),
  `GET /auth/all-users` (200, 25 rows), and `GET /business/get-businesses`
  with `x-client-user-id` set to each of the 8 distinct `firebaseId`s that
  own the 9 baseline businesses — all 200, correct data, admin-bypass path
  in `FirebaseAuthGuard` confirmed working with zero `delegation` rows.
- **No code changes needed** — the two things that could plausibly have
  broken (missing subscription row for the admin, missing business row for
  the admin) are both already handled gracefully by existing code
  (`UsersService.findFireUser`, `BillingGuard`).
- This row does **not** go in `cutover.sql` — rehearsal-copy convenience
  only, tied to a dev-only Firebase UID. It also does not survive a
  re-import (already re-imported 3 times this project) — recreate with
  `MODE=apply node backend/scripts/qa/seed-qa-admin-user.js` (idempotent).
  Re-verify with `backend/scripts/qa/verify-qa-impersonation.js`. Full
  details: `docs/redesign/qa-access.md`.
- Also added the small boot-time log line discussed alongside the Gap 7
  guard: `app.module.ts` now logs `DB_DATABASE=... synchronize=...` as one
  line on every boot (`[Bootstrap]` logger), right next to the guard that
  depends on the same two values — confirmed present in the QA boot log
  above (`DB_DATABASE=keepintax_prodcopy synchronize=false`).

**Follow-up same day — real frontend bug found by actually clicking
through impersonation (not just the API-level checks above):** entering
as a client hid the bookkeeping tabs and made expenses unreachable.
Root cause: `BillingStateService` caches billing/module-access state
until explicitly refreshed, and `AppComponent.subscribeToSelectedClient()`
refreshed `viewAsUserData`/`businesses` on every client switch but never
billing state — so every module-gated tab/route kept evaluating against
whichever identity's billing loaded first (the admin/accountant's own),
not the impersonated client's. Fixed with one call to
`billingStateService.refreshBillingState()` in
`subscribeToSelectedClient()` (both the enter- and exit-client-view
branches), which covers every caller of `ClientPanelService.setSelectedClient()`
— admin clients-dashboard, `demo-data`, and (relevant beyond QA)
the accountant's `clients-panel.page.ts` Phase 5 path. Full writeup:
`docs/redesign/qa-access.md`. Not browser-tested live (no browser
automation available this session) — verified by full code-path trace +
clean typecheck; flagging that explicitly rather than claiming it as
UI-tested.

## 2026-07-12 — Regression: Phase 2.4 missed the documents/OCR consumer path

`GET /documents/me/catalog` 500'd against `keepintax_prodcopy`: "Unknown
column 'DefaultSubCategory.subAccountCode' in 'field list'". Root cause:
`DocumentsService.buildExtractionCatalog` (flagged as a consumer in audit
§5.6) was never ported when Phase 2.4-2.7 (commit `84078bc4`) cut every
*other* catalog CRUD/read path over to `CatalogService` — it was still
reading the legacy `DefaultSubCategory`/`UserSubCategory` tables directly.
`DefaultSubCategory.subAccountCode` was never actually present in
`keepintax_prodcopy` (schema-drift.md Gap 1, known since Phase 0) — any
plain TypeORM `.find()` against the real prod-shaped DB was always going to
crash this way; it only worked in prior dev testing against
`keepintax-dev`, where the shared DB's `synchronize=true` had silently
added the column. Because this endpoint 500'd, the report-review screen's
category/sub-category dropdowns rendered empty and
`ReportReviewService.getReportPreview` step 1 (`processInboxForUser`)
failed with the same error — same root cause, not a separate bug.

Fix: added `CatalogService.getMergedExpenseCatalog(ctx)` (merged
CLIENT > ACCOUNTANT > SYSTEM by name, EXPENSE categories only, across ALL
categories at once — unlike `getMergedSubCategories`, not scoped to one
`categoryId`). `buildExtractionCatalog` now calls this and maps the result
into the same legacy `CatalogEntry` shape Claude/the review dropdown
already expect. `documents.module.ts` now wires `CatalogService` +
`AccountCodeAllocatorService` + the `Category`/`SubCategory`/
`AccountingSection` entities the same way `BookkeepingService` was already
directly provided there (rather than importing `BookkeepingModule`,
matching the module's existing pattern); the `DefaultSubCategory`/
`UserSubCategory` repo injections are gone from both the module and the
service — `buildExtractionCatalog` was their only use in this module.

Grepped the whole backend for remaining `DefaultSubCategory`/
`UserSubCategory`/`DefaultCategory`/`UserCategory` reads outside frozen
entities and migration scripts, per the bug report's instruction: the only
other live one is the already-documented deliberate `getPnlCategoryMap`
holdout in `expenses.service.ts` (explicit `select` that never touches
`subAccountCode` — safe, Phase 4.4 to remove). Found one dead-code
leftover: `TransactionsService.findSubCategoryDetails`/`classifyTransaction`
in `transactions.service.ts` still reads both legacy tables, but it's
unreachable — `POST /transactions/classify-trans` routes through
`TransactionProcessingService.classifyManually`/`classifyWithRule` instead
(confirmed via the controller). Left alone: it's dead code under the
separate `TODO_FINTAX_REMOVE_LEGACY_TRANSACTIONS` effort, not a live
consumer, and not part of this bug.

Verified live: booted the backend against `keepintax_prodcopy`
(`PORT=3001`), hit `GET /documents/me/catalog` impersonating a real
baseline client — `500` → `200`, 73 entries returned. Added regression
tests: `catalog.service.spec.ts` (3 new cases for
`getMergedExpenseCatalog` — cross-category merge, CLIENT-override
precedence, EXPENSE-only filtering) and a new
`documents-catalog.service.spec.ts` (verifies the `CatalogEntry` mapping
and that a legacy repo is never touched again). Full backend suite: 12/18
suites pass; the 6 that fail are pre-existing DI-wiring/type issues in
unrelated spec files (`reports.service.spec.ts`, `reports.controller.spec.ts`,
`report-workflow.service.spec.ts`, `users.controller.spec.ts`,
`users.service.spec.ts`, `auth.service.spec.ts`) — none reference
`CatalogService`, `SubCategory`, or anything touched here.

Not done this session (Elazar doing it manually): re-checking the
review-screen percent-display glitch (66/67/100/0) now that the catalog
isn't empty — flagged in the original bug report as likely downstream of
this same fix, not confirmed either way yet.

## 2026-07-12 — Session 7 (Phase 3, all tasks — Phase 3 COMPLETE)

Read the master plan in full per CLAUDE.md's standing instruction. Ran
Phase 3.1–3.6 against `keepintax_prodcopy`, appended cutover.sql Section 6,
`Current phase` set to `4`.

- **3.1 — D6 schema**: `backend/scripts/migrations/2026-07-13_phase3_schema.sql`
  (+ `2026-07-13_run-phase3-schema.js` raw-mysql2 runner, same no-NestJS-boot
  pattern as every prior DDL script — the app's entities already declare the
  renamed/new columns, so booting against the pre-DDL schema would 1054 on
  the first Expense query). `RENAME COLUMN` (MySQL 8.0.8+, confirmed 8.0.37)
  renamed `expense.taxPercent/vatPercent/isEquipment/reductionPercent` to
  their `*Snapshot` names in place — no data copy, per D6's explicit
  instruction. Added the rest of D6's columns to `expense`
  (`subCategoryId`, `sectionId/Code/NameSnapshot`, `accountId/Code/
  NameSnapshot`, `code6111Snapshot`, `description`, `approvalStatus` — new
  `ExpenseApprovalStatus` enum, deliberately separate from sub_category's
  own `ApprovalStatus` since the value sets differ, `enum.ts`), plus
  `approvedByUserId/At`, `classificationOverrideByUserId/At`. Added
  `subCategoryId` (display-only, no FK — matching the established
  no-real-FK precedent for `sub_category.categoryId/accountId`) to
  `supplier`/`classified_transactions`/`extracted_document`, and
  `extracted_document.document_kind` (new `DocumentKind` enum, kept varchar
  not real ENUM — matching that table's own established convention for
  `status`/`documentType`, unlike `expense.approvalStatus` which follows the
  redesign's own real-ENUM convention).
  **Rename ripple** (the entity rename touches every call site, not just
  the entity file — mapped exhaustively via a research pass before editing,
  distinguishing genuine `Expense` field usages from same-named fields on
  `JournalLine`/`BookingAccount`/`Supplier`/`ClassifiedTransactions`/
  `SlimTransaction`): `expenses.service.ts` (`addExpense`/`updateExpense`/
  `buildExpenseJournalLines`/`getExpensesForReductionReport` — including an
  explicit `newExpense.reductionPercentSnapshot = expense.reductionPercent`
  mapping, since `expense_repo.create(dto)`'s auto field-name-mapping stops
  working for a renamed column and this one wasn't already explicitly
  reassigned like the other three were), `transactions.service.ts`
  (`saveTransactionsToExpenses`), `transaction-processing.service.ts`
  (`syncExpenseFromSlim`), `reports.service.ts` (`createForm1342Report`),
  `expenses-journal.service.spec.ts` (`makeExpense` factory + per-test
  overrides). `tsc --noEmit` diffed byte-identical before/after (same 23
  pre-existing lines, users/report-workflow specs, untouched); full backend
  Jest suite: 12/18 → confirmed via this session's own run 6 failed/12
  passed, same 6 pre-existing suites as every prior session
  (reports.service/controller, report-workflow.service,
  users.controller/service, auth.service specs) — nothing newly broken.
- **3.2 — subCategoryId backfill**: `backend/scripts/migrations/
  2026-07-13_phase3_backfill.ts` (MODE=review/apply, same pattern as the
  Phase 2.2 script). Resolved all 85 expense rows (22 distinct (category,
  subCategory, businessNumber) pairs) via `CatalogService.resolveByName` —
  **0 orphans**, exactly matching D14's "production has zero orphans"
  expectation; the explicit stop-and-show-me gate was never triggered.
  `docs/redesign/orphan-resolution.md` written per the plan's "do not guess
  silently" instruction (documents the zero-orphan result, not just the
  happy path).
- **3.3 — snapshots from the journal**: for each expense, resolved its
  journal entry (`journalEntryNumber`, falling back to
  `referenceType=EXPENSE`+`referenceId` — same lookup order as
  `syncExpenseJournalEntry`) and the one `journal_line` row with
  `subCategoryName IS NOT NULL` (the expense line; VAT/bank lines never set
  it) — 85/85 resolved cleanly. Snapshot columns filled from THAT line's
  `accountCode` (the journal, not the live catalog) via a `booking_account`
  lookup. Spot-checked: the 6 D14/D15 Bituach Leumi expenses correctly
  snapshot onto the 90300 technical account with `sectionIdSnapshot = NULL`
  (no P&L section, matching D14 decision 3) — asserted in
  `verify-phase3-backfill.ts`, not just eyeballed. All 85 → `approvalStatus
  = APPROVED` (every production expense already has a journal entry, since
  `addExpense` has always posted one synchronously at creation — there's no
  PENDING/APPROVED split in the write path yet, that's Phase 4.1).
- **3.4 — description backfill**: new `backend/src/expenses/
  expense-description.util.ts` (`buildExpenseDescription`, D7's fallback
  chain: classification → recognized-doc-type → "מסמך לא מזוהה"). Every
  production expense already has non-null `category`/`subCategory` (NOT
  NULL columns), so branch 1 always applied — 85/85 got
  `"{category}/{subCategory}"`. `journal_entry.description` backfill was a
  confirmed no-op (0 rows) — every EXPENSE-referenced entry already carries
  `"EXPENSE #N - supplier"` from `buildJournalEntryInput`, so the
  WHERE-empty guard never fired; the UPDATE is still in cutover.sql,
  idempotently guarded, for the rare legacy entry that might lack one.
- **3.5 — FK constraint + shadow-table backfill**: `fk_expense_sub_category`
  (`expense.subCategoryId` → `sub_category.id`, `ON DELETE SET NULL` — D6
  singles this one out as "real DB constraint"; the shadow-table pointers
  stay plain nullable ints with no enforced FK, matching precedent).
  Applied only after 3.2's backfill confirmed 0 NULLs. Shadow-table
  best-effort backfill (not a hard stop, per plan): `supplier` 11/11,
  `classified_transactions` 195/196 (1 legacy rule's category/subCategory
  pair didn't resolve — left NULL, logged), `extracted_document` 33/33 +
  `documentKind` 33/33 (all `EXPENSE_INVOICE` — every OCR'd doc in this
  dataset is either already confirmed to an Expense or a plain
  invoice/receipt/tax_invoice_receipt type; none hit the ANNUAL_DOCUMENT or
  UNIDENTIFIED buckets in this baseline).
- **3.6 — verification**: new committed `backend/scripts/
  verify-phase3-backfill.ts` — all checks green (0 NULL subCategoryId/
  snapshot/description/approvalStatus on APPROVED rows, FK constraint
  confirmed present, 0 orphaned subCategoryId refs, D14/D15 spot-check).
  Re-ran `generate-baseline-reports.ts` (into the same
  `baseline-reports-post-migration` dir Session 5 established) +
  `compare-baseline-reports.ts` fresh, post-Phase-3: **all 9 businesses ✅,
  zero un-registered diffs** — expected, since Phase 3 touches no
  `journal_entry`/`journal_line` values, but confirmed empirically rather
  than assumed.
- **cutover.sql Section 6**: appended 6a (schema DDL) / 6b (FK constraint)
  / 6c (literal data — generated by new
  `2026-07-13_generate-phase3-sql.ts`, same "bake in the exact resolved
  values" precedent as Section 4b, rather than have cutover.sql re-resolve
  live against production's catalog state at cutover time). Flagged in the
  section's own header: the embedded `subCategoryId` values are only
  self-consistent with Section 4b's own baked-in ids as long as Sections
  3–6 run together against one fresh dump in one pass (the cutover
  checklist's own "full rehearsal" requirement) — if Section 4b is ever
  regenerated independently before cutover, Section 6c must be regenerated
  too. Deliberately did NOT run a full fresh-dump end-to-end rehearsal of
  the cumulative cutover.sql this session — that's explicitly Session 12
  (Cutover prep) / the production cutover checklist's step 1, out of this
  session's scope.

**Phase 3 checklist status**: 3.1–3.6 all ticked `[x]`. **Phase 3 is
COMPLETE** per its Definition of Done (every approved expense has FK +
snapshot + frozen description; orphan decision doc resolved — trivially,
since there were zero orphans to resolve). `Current phase` set to `4` in
`CLAUDE.md`.

**Next**: Phase 4 (code cutover — write paths start using `subCategoryId`
directly, `resolveAccountCode` adapter deleted) — a fresh session per the
runbook's Session 8.

## Session 8 — 2026-07-12 — Phase 4 write paths (4.1–4.3) + deferred 0.3 security fixes (D12)

Seven commits, each with its checkbox tick. Plan approved in Plan Mode with
four adjustments (supplier auto-create inside the shared tx; the null-
vatReportingDate lock branch applies to JOURNALED rows only; D8's
NOT_AN_EXPENSE wording moved to extracted_document; deleteExpense's orphaned
journal entry promoted to explicit task 4.3b for Session 9).

- **0.3 / D12 (4 commits)** — the deferred security fixes:
  - D12.1: `load-default-categories` endpoint was already deleted in Phase
    2.6 — removed the two stale `.http` scratch entries.
  - D12.2: `FirebaseAuthGuard` now filters `status=ACTIVE` (REVOKED
    delegations no longer grant impersonation) and enforces write scopes by
    HTTP method (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE require `DOCUMENTS_WRITE`; NULL-scopes
    legacy rows are read-only). `request.user.actorFirebaseId` preserves the
    caller's own identity through the impersonation swap (4.2's override
    stamps and D12.3's self-check consume it). `grantPermission` (invite
    flow) now sets ACTIVE + READ/WRITE scopes explicitly. Guard unit spec
    (10 tests). Prodcopy data check: 5 delegations, all ACTIVE — enforcement
    blocks exactly the 3 grant-view READ-only rows from writing.
  - D12.3: `GET delegations/users-for-agent/:agentId` had NO guard
    (unauthenticated enumeration of any agent's client list). Now
    FirebaseAuthGuard + self-or-admin against `actorFirebaseId` (pre-swap —
    the frontend sends `x-client-user-id` on every request while
    impersonating, so a post-swap comparison would break the clients panel).
  - D12.4: named `ux_business_number` UNIQUE on `business.businessNumber` +
    friendly ConflictException pre-checks on all three insert paths
    (createBusiness / signup loop / createClientByAccountant — the latter
    BEFORE the Firebase user is created). Duplicate 314719279: Elazar chose
    to delete business id=5 (zero activity); applied to keepintax_prodcopy
    (24 rows, 0 dups, index verified) + cutover.sql section with a
    verification SELECT that re-checks production for NEW duplicates at
    cutover time. ⚠ **Open item — keepintax-dev has 3 duplicate groups of
    its own** (orphan business rows ids 1,3 whose owner user is gone + the
    accountant test account and the demo user both on fake 123456789);
    synchronize will FAIL to create the index on the next dev boot until
    resolved. Proposed fix (blocked by permission classifier, needs Elazar's
    go-ahead): delete orphans 1+3, renumber the accountant row id=2 to an
    unused placeholder (zero rows reference its number; all 123456789
    activity belongs to the demo user).
- **4.1 — expense write paths on the new model**: every path funnels through
  `resolveExpenseClassification` + `applyClassificationToExpense`
  (subCategoryId wins, name pair fallback until 4.6): FK + section/account/
  6111 snapshots + D7 description + approvalStatus written together.
  Enforcement matrix: mapped+APPROVED → APPROVED + journal; unmapped/pending
  → MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING with NO journal entry; isPrivate → APPROVED,
  never journaled; unresolvable → **400 (the 60000 fallback is dead in the
  write path)**. `addExpense` takes an optional caller `EntityManager` — the
  three review-modal approve paths join one genuine transaction (old
  nested-tx bug fixed) and the supplier auto-create moved inside it.
  `buildExpenseJournalLines` reads `accountCodeSnapshot` (one name retry for
  legacy rows, else throw); `journal_entry.description = expense.description`
  (D7). D10 lock: `assertExpensePeriodUnlocked` throws 423
  `expense_period_locked` (isReported flag — now stamped/cleared live by
  report-workflow lock/unlock — or vatReportingDate ∈ REPORTED VAT workflow
  labels, or date-in-period for JOURNALED rows only). `updateExpense`
  re-resolves through the catalog ('רכוש קבוע' special-case deleted),
  blocks journaled→unmappable with 400, auto-approves+journals a completed
  mapping. `syncExpenseFromSlim` skips overridden expenses (D10 stickiness)
  and routes through new `reclassifyExpenseFromNames`.
  `CatalogService.resolveSubCategory` gained a tenant-scope check (cross-
  tenant id guessing 404s). Fixed in a follow-up commit: every module that
  re-provides ExpensesService (app/transactions/reports) needed the
  ReportWorkflow entity in its forFeature — caught by the prodcopy boot.
- **4.2 — reclassification endpoints (D10)**: `PATCH expenses/:id/
  reclassify` (card law only, stamps `classificationOverrideByUserId =
  actorFirebaseId`), `PATCH expenses/:id/override-mapping` (exactly-one-of
  accountId/accountCode via new scoped lookups `findAccountByIdInScope`/
  `findAccountByCodeInScope`), `PATCH bookkeeping/sub-categories/:id/account`
  → `CatalogService.repointSubCategoryAccount` (D9 future-mapping primitive;
  SYSTEM rows get a same-named CLIENT override; history never moves).
- **4.3 — OCR documentKind routing (D8)**: `deriveDocumentKind` util at both
  OCR insert points + `subCategoryId` stamped by name-matching Claude's pair
  against the same catalog it classified from (`CatalogEntry` +=
  `subCategoryId`, kept out of the prompt block to preserve the Anthropic
  cache prefix). `ExtractedDocStatus += NOT_AN_EXPENSE` (varchar — no
  ALTER). Approve paths 400 ANNUAL_DOCUMENT rows and flip approved docs to
  EXPENSE_INVOICE in-tx. New `POST reports/me/review/file-doc/:documentId`
  ("תייק" — minimal terminal state, slim reset + pair cascade factored out
  of archiveDocument; annual_report_file bridge deferred to Phase 6) and
  `PATCH reports/me/review/doc-kind/:documentId` (PENDING_REVIEW triage).
  `ReviewDocSummary` carries `documentKind`. D8 wording corrected in the
  master plan (approved).
- **Tests**: 145+ green across guard/delegation/expenses/catalog/report-
  workflow/documents suites, incl. new `expense-classification.spec.ts`,
  `firebase-auth.guard.spec.ts`, `delegation.controller.spec.ts`,
  `document-kind.spec.ts`, `report-review-dockind.spec.ts`. Also fixed the
  report-workflow lock spec, which was failing BEFORE this session (missing
  constructor arg). Pre-existing failures unrelated to this session (users/
  reports scaffold "should be defined" specs) remain.
- **Verification**: full AppModule booted against `keepintax_prodcopy`
  (NODE_ENV=production, SKIP_BOOT_SEED=true) via
  `generate-baseline-reports.ts` regeneration into
  `baseline-reports-post-migration` + `compare-baseline-reports.ts`:
  **all 9 businesses ✅, zero un-registered diffs** (read paths untouched
  this session — confirmed empirically, per D15). The boot itself caught
  the ReportWorkflow-entity DI gap fixed in the follow-up commit.

**Phase 4 checklist status**: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 ticked; 4.3b (deleteExpense
journal fix, added this session per Elazar), 4.4–4.6 remain. 0.3 ticked —
the deferred D12 security fixes are closed. Note per the 0.3 execution
rule: D12.1–D12.3 are code-only and immediately deployable to production;
D12.4's schema half (dedup + UNIQUE) rides cutover.sql instead, only its
code pre-checks are deploy-safe now.

**Next**: Session 9 — 4.3b (deleteExpense must remove/reverse its journal
entry in the same tx, D10 lock applying to deletes) + 4.4 (reports read
side: P&L by section, ledger from stored descriptions). Elazar decisions
pending: the keepintax-dev duplicate cleanup above.

### Session 8 addendum — keepintax-dev business dedup (approved by Elazar)

Cleared the 3 duplicate `businessNumber` groups on the SHARED keepintax-dev
DB so synchronize can create `ux_business_number` on the next dev boot:

- Deleted orphan `business` rows **id=1** (פורטי פייב, 304902133) and
  **id=3** (אוריה הראל אדריכלות, 204245724) — their owner firebaseId
  (`O8OaV9fyVsV29h63DszM78KYVqb2`) has no `user` row and zero activity;
  the surviving rows (ids 7/8) belong to harelazar@gmail.com.
- Renumbered **id=2** (the harel.taxit@gmail.com accountant test account's
  own business, previously fake `123456789`) to placeholder `999999999` —
  zero expenses/journal entries/documents referenced the old number; all
  `123456789` activity belongs to the demo user (demo@gmail.com), which
  keeps that number. ⚠ If anyone else uses the harel.taxit test account
  and something keys on its business number, it is now `999999999`.

Verified: zero duplicate groups remain on keepintax-dev.

## Session 9 — 2026-07-12 — Phase 4 complete: 4.3b + reports/manual-entry/dead-code (4.4–4.6)

Four commits, each with its checkbox tick. Phase 4 is DONE — plan header
bumped to `Current phase: 5`.

- **4.3b — deleteExpense journal fix (the active accounting bug from
  Session 8's plan review)**: new `BookkeepingService.deleteJournalEntry`
  (hard delete of header + lines; the per-business entryNumber sequence is
  NOT compacted — a display gap is safer than renumbering). `deleteExpense`
  asserts the D10 period lock (423 `expense_period_locked`) BEFORE touching
  anything — the lock now covers deletes exactly like edits — resolves the
  entry via journalEntryNumber → reference lookup (expense.id, then
  expenseNumber, mirroring syncExpenseJournalEntry), and removes entry +
  expense in ONE dataSource.transaction. Unjournaled (MISSING/private) rows
  delete the expense only. Storno stays out of scope per D10.
- **4.4 — reports to sections (D3) + stored descriptions (D7)**:
  `createPnLReportFromJournal` joins booking_account scoped by chartOwnerKey
  (SYSTEM + CLIENT_<biz>; the ACCOUNTANT chart joins in Phase 5.1) → INNER
  JOIN accounting_section; income/expense split by account `type` instead of
  hardcoded code prefixes, so 50000/70000/80000-range accounts roll up
  correctly once they exist. Pre-flight against prodcopy confirmed every
  posted account's section name is string-identical to its pnlCategory →
  output-identical switch (D15). `ExpensePnlDto.category` → `sectionName`
  (PDF renderer + frontend P&L page + the baseline comparator, which now
  keys P&L rows by `sectionName ?? category` so the golden fixtures predate
  the rename cleanly). Ledger + entry-detail expense lines read the STORED
  `journal_entry.description` (Phase-3 backfill coverage on prodcopy: 85/85
  expense lines), `jl.subCategoryName` kept as pre-backfill fallback;
  VAT/income/bank computed labels unchanged. Deleted `getPnlCategoryMap` +
  the `resolvedPnlCategory` attach — the bookkeeping expenses-table column
  now shows `expense.sectionNameSnapshot`. `booking_account.pnlCategory` is
  now fully unread at runtime (column kept for rollback until Phase 7).
- **4.5 — manual journal entry on the new catalog**: `GET
  reports/ledger-entry-accounts` is business-scoped (SYSTEM + CLIENT chart,
  isActive only) and carries sectionCode/sectionName — the modal's account
  dropdown renders sections as option groups. New `GET
  bookkeeping/expense-catalog` feeds the optional sub_category picker
  (merged catalog, isPrivate excluded per D5). DTO: free-text
  `subCategoryName` REPLACED by `subCategoryId` (resolved tenant-scope-
  checked via CatalogService → ledger-line name snapshot; cross-tenant ids
  404 before anything is written) + new free-text `description` —
  `je.description` = free text ‖ derived "category/sub" ‖ legacy reference
  fallback (D7: the ledger shows this stored text since 4.4).
  BookkeepingService now injects CatalogService. Frontend modal: sub_category
  dropdown + "פירוט" free-text replace the old תת-קטגוריה input; accounts +
  catalog load on modal open with the selected business.
- **4.6 — legacy resolver + old-table reads deleted**:
  `CatalogService.resolveAccountCode` (silent-60000 bridge) + the
  ExpensesService wrapper + catalog-parity.spec.ts gone
  (`resolveSubAccountCode` had already been deleted in an earlier session).
  TransactionsService: dead legacy `classifyTransaction` (controller routes
  to TransactionProcessingService) + `findSubCategoryDetails` deleted; the
  legacy transactions-table category filter reads new
  `CatalogService.getCategoryNamesForUser`. TransactionProcessingService's
  never-used old-repo injections removed. Demo-data reset now wipes the demo
  user's NEW-catalog CLIENT rows (sub_category → category → booking_account
  → accounting_section, FK order) — closing a gap where reset left
  new-catalog rows behind. The four legacy entities are out of every
  forFeature list; they remain ONLY in app.module's forRoot entities (frozen
  tables stay schema-managed for rollback until the Phase 7 drop). DoD grep:
  zero runtime reads/writes of the old four tables — remaining references
  are the entity files themselves (headers updated to say so), the forRoot
  registration, legacy-SHAPED DTO/method names on the unchanged API surface,
  and comments/docs.
- **Tests**: 182 green across the redesign suites (expenses/bookkeeping/
  documents/reports/report-workflow/guards/delegation), incl. new
  deleteExpense (5) + deleteJournalEntry (3) + manual-entry picker (5) +
  ledger-description D7 (7) + expense-description.util chain (7) +
  getCategoryNamesForUser cases. Only the pre-existing users/reports
  scaffold "should be defined" spec failures remain (verified pre-existing
  in Session 8 via git stash).
- **Verification**: full AppModule booted against `keepintax_prodcopy`
  (NODE_ENV=production, SKIP_BOOT_SEED=true) — regenerated
  baseline-reports-post-migration + compare-baseline-reports.ts:
  **all 9 businesses ✅, zero un-registered diffs** (D15). The fixture
  changes are exactly the ExpensePnlDto field rename (category →
  sectionName) with identical section names and totals — the section
  switch is empirically output-identical. The boot itself re-verified the
  Session-9 DI/module changes (forFeature cleanups, CatalogService into
  BookkeepingService/TransactionsService).
- **CLAUDE.md docs synced**: expenses, bookkeeping, reports, transactions,
  demo-data, frontend ledger-report.

**Phase 4 checklist status**: 4.1–4.6 + 4.3b ALL ticked — Phase 4 complete.
`Current phase: 5`. **Next**: Session 10 — Phase 5 (accountant layer):
delegation-aware authorization on catalog/approval endpoints, the D11
add-account flow, the client-unmapped flow (D5), and the accountant catalog
management backend.


---

## Session 10 — 2026-07-13 — Phase 5 complete: accountant layer (5.1–5.4)

Four commits, each with its checkbox tick. Phase 5 is DONE — plan header
bumped to `Current phase: 6`. Two decisions confirmed with Elazar up front
(AskUserQuestion): the D11 DTO carries a `categoryName` (the paired
sub_category needs a parent category, which D11's field list omitted — a
category picker joins the Phase 6 screen), and D9 mapping-completion
auto-approves + journals (consistent with 4.2's overrideExpenseMapping).

- **5.1 — delegation-aware authorization (`c2c35a9d`)**: the ACCOUNTANT
  catalog layer goes live. `CatalogContext.accountantId` existed since 2.3
  but NO caller ever populated it — the accountant layer was invisible
  everywhere. New `CatalogContextService` (bookkeeping):
  `forUser(firebaseId, businessNumber)` fills `ctx.accountantIds` from the
  user's ACTIVE delegations — each agent's `ACCOUNTANT_<id>` chart joins
  the D4 merge between CLIENT and SYSTEM (deterministic delegation-id order
  for the rare multi-accountant case; visibility deliberately NOT gated on
  write scopes — scopes gate capabilities, D9). Threaded through EVERY
  resolution/merge point: expense classification (all 4
  resolveExpenseClassification callers pass the owner userId),
  override-mapping account lookups, get-categories/get-sub-categories,
  isEquipment/reportScope resolvers, the buildExpenseJournalLines legacy
  retry, manual-entry sub_category resolution + repoint + expense-catalog
  endpoints, OCR buildExtractionCatalog (firebaseId is now load-bearing
  there), the P&L booking-account join (closing 4.4's explicit "accountant
  chart joins in 5.1" TODO), and getLedgerEntryAccounts (accountant cards
  postable in manual entries). Safety: `repointSubCategoryAccount` now
  protects ACCOUNTANT rows exactly like SYSTEM rows — a client-context
  repoint lands a same-named CLIENT override, never edits the shared row
  (which would silently re-map every other client of that accountant).
  SYSTEM-catalog admin endpoints check `isAdmin` against `actorFirebaseId`
  (admin-while-impersonating passes; accountant is refused) and the
  previously commented-out `getAllDefaultSubCategories` admin check is
  enforced (verified: only the admin panel calls it). DI note: only
  documents.module provides CatalogService directly — it now also provides
  CatalogContextService; everyone else gets it via BookkeepingModule's
  exports.
- **5.2 — D11 add-account flow (`034b9446`)**:
  `POST /bookkeeping/accounts` → `CatalogService.createAccountWithSubCategory`
  — ONE dataSource.transaction writes the law-bearing card (percents/
  isEquipment/recognition/section/6111 all ON the account, revised D1) +
  the same-named thin sub_category, unless `technicalOnly`. Scoping:
  ALL_MY_CLIENTS → ACCOUNTANT rows/70000-range/ALL_ACCOUNTANT_CLIENTS;
  CURRENT_CLIENT → CLIENT rows/80000-range with `accountantId`=creator +
  SPECIFIC_CLIENT (D4). Manual codes accepted when unique within the
  chartOwnerKey (out-of-range 90xxx tolerated per D2) else allocated
  in-transaction. Section always required — sectionless cards are invisible
  to the manual-entry dropdown, which is where technical cards get used
  (resolves Session 3A's open question about a 90000-range allocator: not
  needed, manual codes cover it). Actor-gated to ACCOUNTANT/ADMIN roles.
  CatalogService now injects DataSource (spec constructions updated).
- **5.3 — client-unmapped flow (`6eeaef06`)**:
  `CreateUserSubCategoryDto.deferToAccountant` saves the row with no law
  and no card → MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING, allowed ONLY when the client
  has an ACTIVE delegation (else 400 — an unaccompanied client is never
  stuck: their path is the D9 simple picker, i.e. a normal mapped create).
  `POST /expenses/:id/complete-mapping` (the D9 inline completion row):
  applyToFuture=false → the 4.2 one-off override path; true →
  `repointSubCategoryAccount` (future expenses follow; CLIENT override row
  when the sub_category is SYSTEM/ACCOUNTANT-owned) then `reclassifyExpense`
  onto the EFFECTIVE row — snapshots + description + journal in one tx,
  approval + D10 override stamped with the actor. The repoint commits
  before the expense tx: a second-step failure leaves a completed mapping
  and a still-pending expense — retryable, never corrupt (flagged, not
  hidden).
- **5.4 — accountant catalog management backend (`26f2ec9b`)**: backend
  only, the screen is Phase 6.2. `GET /bookkeeping/catalog-overview`: every
  active category/sub_category row across the visible layers, deliberately
  UNcollapsed, each with owner badge fields + `isEffective` (the D4 winner
  per (categoryName, name)); sub-rows surface their card's full law.
  `GET /bookkeeping/pending-approvals`: actor-keyed (ACCOUNTANT/ADMIN gate),
  MISSING_ACCOUNTING_MAPPING / PENDING_ACCOUNTANT_APPROVAL sub_categories
  across ALL the agent's ACTIVE-delegation clients, each with its
  blocked-expense count (CatalogService gained an Expense repo injection
  for the counts).
- **Tests**: new `catalog-context.service.spec.ts` (10), +15 CatalogService
  cases (accountant-layer precedence, ACCOUNTANT-repoint protection, the 7
  D11 cases, overview/queue), +5 completeExpenseMapping/defer cases. Full
  backend suite: 266/269 tests, 24/29 suites green — the 5 failing suites
  (users.service/users.controller/auth.service/reports.service/
  reports.controller scaffold specs) are the SAME pre-existing failures
  noted every prior session; nothing newly broken. `tsc --noEmit`: only the
  2 pre-existing users spec files.
- **Verification**: full AppModule booted against `keepintax_prodcopy`
  (NODE_ENV=production + SKIP_BOOT_SEED=true; boot log confirmed
  `synchronize=false`) — regenerated `baseline-reports-post-migration` +
  `compare-baseline-reports.ts`: **all 9 businesses ✅, zero un-registered
  diffs** (D15). The regenerated fixtures differ from Session 9's ONLY in
  the `generatedAt` timestamp — Phase 5 is empirically output-identical on
  data with no ACCOUNTANT-owned rows (prodcopy has none yet; the 5
  delegations there gate impersonation, not catalog rows). The boot also
  re-verified the Session-10 DI changes end-to-end.

**Phase 5 checklist status**: 5.1–5.4 ALL ticked — Phase 5 complete per its
Definition of Done (an accountant can fully service a client — create
accounts, complete mappings, approve — with enforced scopes; a client
without an accountant is never blocked). No cutover.sql changes: Phase 5 is
code-only, zero schema/data changes. `Current phase: 6`.

**Next**: Sessions 11A/11B — Phase 6 frontend (approval screen per D9;
category management / modal-add-expenses / ledger+P&L pages on the new
APIs). The 5.4 endpoints and the D11 POST are consumed by 6.1/6.2.

## Session 11B — 2026-07-13 — Phase 6 tasks 6.2–6.4 (parallel with 11A)

Ran as the 11B half of the 11A‖11B pair, same working tree as a live 11A
session (see "parallel-session note" below).

- **6.2a — client add-category/sub_category, D5 three-option flow
  (`ae7428bf`)**: AddCategoryComponent rebuilt — per-row radio
  מוכרת / לא מוכרת / פרטית replaces the isRecognized checkbox. RECOGNIZED
  requires either the D9 simple picker "למה ההוצאה שייכת?" (options =
  GET bookkeeping/expense-catalog, which now returns `accountId` per row;
  card-bearing rows only) or "השאר לרואה החשבון" — shown only when
  delegations/my-permissions reports an agent, mirroring the backend's
  ACTIVE-delegation 400. Percent/isEquipment/pnlCategory inputs removed
  (the card carries the law, D1). Thin backend glue:
  CreateUserSubCategoryDto += isPrivate + accountId (accountId
  scope-checked via findAccountByIdInScope); CreateUserCategoryDto +=
  defaultRecognitionType (UI hint stamped on the category). Income mode
  keeps the legacy payload untouched.
- **6.2b — accountant catalog tab (`894eca3f`)**: clients-panel gains
  "קטלוג וכרטיסים": the 5.4 pending-approvals queue (client / category /
  sub / status / blocked-expense count), a per-client catalog-overview
  table (D4 owner badges, card+section+law columns, isEffective — losers
  greyed), and the D11 "כרטיס חדש" dialog (name, section picker, manual
  code, 6111, recognition, percents, isEquipment, all-my-clients /
  current-client, technicalOnly, parent category + datalist). New backend
  GET bookkeeping/sections (ACCOUNTANT/ADMIN-gated; nothing listed
  sections with ids before) and CreateAccountDto.businessNumber (the
  businessnumber header belongs to the interceptor's view-as state — the
  panel passes the target business explicitly). Overview/CURRENT_CLIENT
  requests ride a per-request x-client-user-id so CatalogContextService
  merges all three layers and the guard enforces the delegation. New
  frontend BookkeepingCatalogService.
- **6.2c — admin SYSTEM catalog screen (`e02a2698`)**:
  toLegacySubCategory += accountName/sectionName/code6111/isPrivate
  (additive; findSubCategoriesByChartOwnerKey now loads account.section).
  CategoryManagementComponent: כרטיס + חתך columns replace the dead
  pnlCategory string (D3); פרטית badge; edit dialog shows the current
  card, names are read-only (the endpoint never applied them), pnlCategory
  inputs gone from add/edit; Excel export reads card fields off the rows
  (getLedgerAccounts lookup + retired subAccountCode column removed, D2;
  the previously-blank 6111 sheet column is now real data).
- **6.3 — modal-add-expenses / add-supplier emit subCategoryId
  (`f4802c3c`)**: both resolve the picked row's id by name from their
  loaded list at submit time and send it as `subCategoryId` (backend
  prefers the FK since 4.1); the modal's inline save-supplier and
  AddSupplierComponent persist it on the supplier row too (only when a
  match is found — never nulls an existing pointer).
  UpdateSupplierDto += optional subCategoryId (whitelist pipe stripped
  it; add-supplier's untyped body already passed it through). Cascading
  pickers + percent autofill were already on the new catalog (2.4).
- **6.4 — ledger/P&L pages (`e2382afe`)**: found that
  GET reports/ledger-accounts returned the ENTIRE booking_account table —
  under the D4 multi-tenant chart that leaks every tenant's custom card
  names into every user's ledger filter. Now scoped like
  ledger-entry-accounts (SYSTEM + CLIENT_<biz> + delegation ACCOUNTANT
  charts) but keeping inactive accounts (they may carry history); the
  page reloads options on business switch and clears an out-of-scope
  pick. P&L section grouping, the ledger פירוט column, and new codes in
  the pickers were verified already delivered by 4.4/4.5 — no changes
  needed there.
- **Drive-by fix (`61560874`)**: settings.page.ts read `this.tabs.some`
  on a computed Signal (missing `()`) — `ng build --configuration
  production` failed at HEAD on it, PRE-existing this session.
- **Verification**: backend `tsc --noEmit` clean (same 2 pre-existing
  users spec files); jest src/bookkeeping+src/expenses: 139/139 green.
  Frontend prod build: after the settings fix, the only remaining errors
  are in 11A's two in-flight report-review frontend files (documentKind
  not yet on ReviewDocSummary) — none in 11B files. A fully green build
  needs 11A to land; re-verify then.
- **Parallel-session note**: 11A was committing in this same tree.
  Two of my early commits raced its index: `e02a2698` (6.2c) also swept
  11A's backend report-review.service.ts+dto (11A then continued with
  `94d39b7e`), and `cbccd1e6` carries only 11A's reports/CLAUDE.md under
  a 6.2c message. Nothing lost; history left un-rewritten deliberately.
  Remedy adopted mid-session: commit with explicit pathspecs
  (`git commit -- <paths>`). Plan checkboxes for 6.2–6.4 left un-ticked —
  the parallelism rules give checkbox updates to the primary session
  (11A); tick them there or at review.
- **Open question for Elazar**: catalog-overview /
  ledger-entry-accounts / catalog reads accept any businessNumber
  query/header without verifying the caller owns that business (the
  guard only validates x-client-user-id delegations) — cross-tenant
  catalog-name exposure. Pre-existing pattern (since 4.5), not changed
  this session; flagging for a Phase 6/7 decision.

---

## Session 11A — 2026-07-13 — Phase 6.1: the D9 approval screen

Three commits (plus two swept into 11B's commits during the parallel-
session index races — see 11B's note; nothing lost). Two decisions
confirmed with Elazar up front: the accountant inline completion runs the
**approve→complete-mapping chain** (approve lands the MISSING expense,
complete-mapping approves + journals — reuses the 5.3 primitives exactly
as built; a mid-chain failure leaves a retryable MISSING expense), and
the operational columns (doc identity, period, actions) **stay** in both
view modes alongside D9's core column sets.

- **6.1a — backend (rode into `e02a2698` + `94d39b7e`)**: every preview
  row now carries `classification: ReviewClassification` — the
  delegation-aware merged-catalog resolution the approve path will run:
  effective subCategoryId, canonical names, status (READY /
  MISSING_MAPPING / PRIVATE / UNCLASSIFIED), the D7 description preview,
  `mappedByAccountant`, and the card's section/account/law. One catalog
  load per preview, in-memory matching; **names win over the OCR-time
  stamped id** (saved-supplier override), stamped id is the renamed-row
  fallback. `ReportPreviewResponse.clientHasActiveDelegation` drives the
  "אצל הרו״ח" vs simple-picker branch. `bookkeeping/expense-catalog`
  gained the card-law/section fields + `includePrivate` (additive on top
  of 11B's `accountId`); `getMergedExpenseCatalog` joins
  `account.section`. 13 new tests (`report-review-classification.spec.ts`).
- **6.1b — frontend (`e08cbcbb`)**: the review dialog IS the D9 screen.
  Toggle persisted per REAL user (`reviewViewMode:<firebaseId>`);
  accountants/admins land on professional. Professional view: single D7
  description column, section column, **card picker** (accounts grouped
  by section via optgroups; resolves to a representative sub_category —
  same-named > alphabetical — preserving approved⇒subCategoryId;
  technical cards excluded), read-only card-law percent columns. Status
  badges per D9+D8; non-approvable rows (MISSING / UNCLASSIFIED / annual
  / unidentified) render disabled checkboxes and are excluded from bulk
  approve + select-all ("נבחרו X מתוך Y ניתנות לאישור"). Accountant
  "השלם מיפוי" dialog = card picker + "החל גם על סיווגים עתידיים"
  checkbox → the approve→complete chain. Unaccompanied client
  "למה ההוצאה שייכת?" = 5 curated system choices (דלק / טיפולים / הוצאות
  משרד / שיווק ופרסום / שכירות משרד) + full by-section list → the 4.2
  repoint primitive, adopting the CLIENT-override id the backend actually
  mapped and re-badging every affected row. D8: annual rows get תייק
  (file-doc) + re-kind; unidentified rows get expense/annual triage in
  place. Every classification change re-applies the extended catalog row
  locally (live-resolution preview); approve sends `subCategoryId` ahead
  of the name pair. Catalog source switched documents/me/catalog →
  extended expense-catalog. `ReviewDocSummary` mirror gained
  `documentKind`.
- **Verification**: `ng build` green on the merged tree (both sessions'
  work; only the long-standing budget/CommonJS warnings). Backend:
  report-review-classification 13/13, report-review-dockind 4/4;
  `tsc --noEmit` clean except the pre-existing users spec files. 11B
  separately ran jest bookkeeping+expenses 139/139.
- **Checkbox bookkeeping (primary session)**: ticked 6.1 (this session)
  and 6.2/6.3/6.4 per 11B's close-out — all Phase 6 tasks delivered.
  `Current phase: cutover-ready` per the runbook. **Still owed for the
  Phase 6 Definition of Done: Elazar's full manual E2E pass** (upload →
  OCR → review → classify → approve → ledger/VAT/P&L, both view modes,
  as client and as accountant) — schedule before Session 12.
- **Open question carried from 11B** (for Elazar): catalog-overview /
  ledger-entry-accounts / catalog reads accept any businessNumber without
  ownership verification — cross-tenant catalog-name exposure,
  pre-existing since 4.5; decide in Phase 6 review or Phase 7.

## Session 11B (cont.) — 2026-07-13 — business-ownership hardening + full green build

Follow-up requested by Elazar after the close-out: the catalog-overview /
ledger-entry-accounts businessNumber-ownership gap flagged as an "open
question" was fixed immediately rather than deferred to Phase 7.

- **Fix**: `CatalogContextService.assertBusinessAccess(firebaseId,
  businessNumber)` — a new Business repo injection checks a
  (businessNumber, firebaseId) row exists (covers MULTI_BUSINESS/spouse
  businesses, same firebaseId on both rows); throws `ForbiddenException`
  otherwise. No-ops when either arg is missing (caller-validated
  elsewhere — matches the existing style of every other guard in this
  module). `forUser` now calls it internally, so EVERY consumer of the
  delegation-aware context is covered in one place: catalog-overview,
  expense-catalog, repoint, classification, OCR extraction catalog, the
  P&L booking-account join. Also applied explicitly at the two endpoints
  that read businessNumber directly rather than through `forUser`
  (`reports.getLedgerAccounts`/`getLedgerEntryAccounts`, both already
  taking firebaseId) and at the two accountant-write paths that accept a
  caller-supplied businessNumber (`POST bookkeeping/accounts`
  CURRENT_CLIENT scope, `createManualJournalEntry` — a foreign-business
  manual entry would otherwise ride that tenant's entry-number sequence).
- **Tests**: `catalog-context.service.spec.ts` gained a `businessRepo`
  mock + an `assertBusinessAccess` describe block (owner incl. spouse
  business passes; foreign/unknown businessNumber rejects; missing arg
  no-ops) and a `forUser` case asserting the same rejection propagates.
  `bookkeeping.service.spec.ts`'s CatalogContextService mock gained the
  new method (existing tests already pass a matching firebaseId/business
  pair, so behavior is unchanged there).
- **Verification**: backend `tsc --noEmit` clean (same 2 pre-existing
  users spec files). `jest src/bookkeeping src/expenses src/documents
  src/reports`: 202/204 — the 2 failures are `reports.service.spec.ts`
  and `reports.controller.spec.ts`, both bare zero-provider scaffold
  tests that fail identically at HEAD before this change (confirmed via
  `git stash`); unrelated to this session. Frontend `ng build
  --configuration production` (11A+11B merged, post 11A's Phase 6
  close-out): **exit 0, fully green** — only pre-existing SCSS/bundle
  budget warnings, no errors.
- Plan checkboxes 6.1-6.4 were already ticked and `Current phase:
  cutover-ready` already set by 11A's close-out (`ba76665d`) — confirmed,
  not re-touched.

## Session 12 — 2026-07-13 — Cutover.sql final review + cutover-day checklist

Assembled the section-by-section review of `cutover.sql` and wrote
`docs/redesign/cutover-day-checklist.md` (the plan's generic 7-step
checklist filled in with real file names/databases). Found and fixed two
real gaps in `cutover.sql` before treating it as final:

- **Stale conflicting Section 2 (business dedup)**: the file had TWO
  sections resolving the same `businessNumber='314719279'` duplicate —
  the original Session-1 placeholder (delete id=12, constraint
  `uq_business_businessNumber`) and the actual Session-8 D12.4 section
  (delete id=5, constraint `ux_business_number`, matching
  `business.entity.ts`). Running the file end-to-end as it stood would
  delete BOTH business rows, not one. Removed the stale Section 2 (left a
  pointer comment explaining why); the D12.4 section at the end of the
  file is the one true version. Elazar confirmed this read and the fix.
- **Missing `journal_entry.referenceId` nullability ALTER**:
  `schema-drift.md` Gap 3 deferred this to "whichever phase introduces
  manual journal entries" (Phase 4.5, live since Session 9 —
  `BookkeepingService.createManualJournalEntry` sets `referenceId: null`),
  but nobody actually appended the ALTER to `cutover.sql` when that phase
  shipped. Production's column is still `int NOT NULL` — first manual
  entry post-cutover would have hard-failed. Added new **Section 7**
  (`ALTER TABLE journal_entry MODIFY referenceId bigint NULL`) with a
  verification query. Elazar confirmed.
- Ran a systematic audit pass: every `*.entity.ts` file touched by any
  redesign commit since Session 1 (2026-07-10) cross-checked against
  `cutover.sql`'s sections. The 2026-07-12 accidental-synchronize incident
  fix (`12840dec`, named `@Unique`/`@Index` decorators on
  category/sub_category/booking_account/accounting_section/
  account_code_migration/extracted_document/`Source`) is naming-only and
  already matches the constraint names `cutover.sql` creates — no action
  needed. No other gaps found.

No code changes this session — `cutover.sql` and this checklist doc only.
Still `Current phase: cutover-ready`; Elazar executes the actual cutover
checklist manually per the plan.
